Reading and Writing Section Explanations

    Information and Ideas

        1.1 Central Ideas and Details: Measures the ability to identify explicitly stated and implicitly conveyed details, and determine the main idea or primary purpose of a passage.

        1.2 Command of Evidence (Textual): Measures the ability to locate and interpret textual evidence to support a claim or answer a question.

        1.3 Command of Evidence (Quantitative): Measures the ability to locate, interpret, evaluate, and integrate information and ideas from informational graphics (tables, bar graphs, line graphs) to support a claim.

        1.4 Inferences: Measures the ability to draw reasonable text-based inferences from passages.

    Craft and Structure

        2.1 Words in Context: Measures the ability to determine the meaning of high-utility academic words and phrases in context.

        2.2 Text Structure and Purpose: Measures the ability to describe the function of a portion of a passage in the context of the passage as a whole, and to determine the purpose or organization of the text.

        2.3 Cross-Text Connections: Measures the ability to make connections between topically related texts, often involving analysis of different points of view or arguments.

    Expression of Ideas

        3.1 Rhetorical Synthesis: Measures the ability to revise texts to improve the effectiveness of written expression and to meet specific rhetorical goals, such as synthesizing information from multiple statements.

        3.2 Transitions: Measures the ability to determine the most effective transition word or phrase to establish logical relationships between ideas.

    Standard English Conventions

        4.1 Boundaries: Measures the ability to edit texts to conform to core conventions of Standard English punctuation (e.g., commas, apostrophes, semicolons, colons, dashes, parentheses).

        4.2 Form, Structure, and Sense: Measures the ability to edit texts to conform to core conventions of Standard English sentence structure and usage (e.g., subject-verb agreement, pronoun agreement, verb tense, parallelism, modifiers).
