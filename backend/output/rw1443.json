        "Reading Passage": "Marta Coll and colleagues’ 2010 Mediterranean Sea biodiversity census reported approximately 17,000 species, nearly double the number reported in Carlo Bianchi and Carla Morri’s 2000 census~—a difference only partly attributable to the description of new invertebrate species in the interim. Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers’ decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed, the two censuses reported similar counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that",

        ],
        "Correct answer": "B",
        "Explanations": [
            "Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate\nspecies in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the\nstudies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues’ count and Bianchi and Morri’s\ncount that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of\nBianchi and Morri’s study.",
            "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text's discussion of the\ndifferent counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the\nnumber of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can\nonly be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means\nthere must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues’ count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri’s count. The\ntext goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms’ morphological\nvariability, or the differences in microorganisms’ structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify\nmicroorganisms by species and means that researchers’ decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect\non the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar\nnumbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from\ndifferences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated\nsome of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas\nBianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many\nmore species than Bianchi and Morri did.",
            "Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been\nless sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues\nwere. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and\nMorri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation\nwould lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as\nvariations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll\nand colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and\nMorri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report\nfewer overall species.",
            "Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported\nmany more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and\ncolleagues would not explain that difference—it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should\nhave been even larger."

The diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature, which coincided with the rise of photography, seems to support this claim.

            "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, conceptual\nartists Gins and Arakawa have designed an apartment building that is disorienting because of several unconventional\nelements, such as uneven kitchen counters and “a door to nowhere.” The text goes on to suggest that there may be benefits\nto this kind of design because filmmaker Yamaoka lived in the apartment building for four years and reported health\nbenefits.
