Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms\nis poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to\nevaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers’ decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed,\nthe two censuses reported similar counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that__\n\nWhich choice most logically completes the text?\n\nColl and colleagues reported a much higher number of species than Bianchi and Morri did largely due to the inclusion of\nA. invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s census.\n\nsome differences observed in microorganisms may have been treated as variations within species by Bianchi and Morri\nB. but treated as indicative of distinct species by Coll and colleagues.\n\nBianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to the degree of morphological variation displayed within a typical\nC. species of microorganism than Coll and colleagues were.\n\nthe absence of clarity regarding how to differentiate among species of microorganisms may have resulted in Coll and\nD. colleagues underestimating the number of microorganism species.\n\nID: f1bfbed3 Answer\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nRationale\nChoice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text's discussion of the\ndifferent counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the\nnumber of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can\nonly be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means\nthere must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues’ count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri’s count. The\ntext goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms’ morphological\nvariability, or the differences in microorganisms’ structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify\nmicroorganisms by species and means that researchers’ decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect\non the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar\nnumbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from\ndifferences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated\nsome of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas\nBianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many\nmore species than Bianchi and Morri did.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate\nspecies in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the\nstudies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues’ count and Bianchi and Morri’s\ncount that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of\nBianchi and Morri’s study. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been\nless sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues\nwere. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and\nMorri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation\nwould lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as\nvariations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll\nand colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and\nMorri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report\nfewer overall species. Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported\nmany more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and\ncolleagues would not explain that difference—it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should\nhave been even larger.\n\nQuestion Difficulty: Hard",

The diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature, which coincided with the\nrise of photography, seems to support this claim. However, photography’s impact on the portrait miniature may be\noverstated. Although records from art exhibitions in the Netherlands from 1820 to 1892 show a decrease in the number of\nboth full-sized and miniature portraits submitted, this trend was established before the invention of photography.\n\nBased on the text, what can be concluded about the diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature in the nineteenth\ncentury?\n\nA. Factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature’s decline.\n\nAlthough portrait miniatures became less common than photographs, they were widely regarded as having more artistic\nB. merit.\n\nC. The popularity of the portrait miniature likely persisted for longer than art historians have assumed.\n\nD. As demand for portrait miniatures decreased, portrait artists likely shifted their creative focus to photography.\n\nID: 87aa7bab Answer\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nRationale\n\nChoice A is the best answer. The text says that the impact of photography on the portrait miniature might be \"overstated,\" as\nsome records show a decrease in the number of portrait miniatures before the invention of photography. From this, we can\nconclude that factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature’s decline.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. The text never discusses the \"artistic merit\" of either art form. Choice C is incorrect. The text never\nsuggests that the portrait miniature was popular for longer than historians thought—if anything, it suggests that the portrait\nminiature started losing its popularity earlier than historians thought. Choice D is incorrect. The text never suggests that\nportrait painters shifted to become photographers.\n\nQuestion Difficulty: Medium",

The effect is disorienting but\ninvigorating: after four years there, filmmaker Nobu Yamaoka reported significant health benefits.\n\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the text?\n\nAlthough inhabiting a home surrounded by fanciful features such as those designed by Gins and Arakawa can be\nA. rejuvenating, it is unsustainable.\n\nDesigning disorienting spaces like those in the Gins and Arakawa building is the most effective way to create a physically\n. stimulating environment.\n\nOw\n\nC.

According to the text, conceptual\nartists Gins and Arakawa have designed an apartment building that is disorienting because of several unconventional\nelements, such as uneven kitchen counters and “a door to nowhere.” The text goes on to suggest that there may be benefits\nto this kind of design because filmmaker Yamaoka lived in the apartment building for four years and reported health\nbenefits. Thus, although the design is impractical, it may improve the well-being of the apartment building's residents.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text mentions that Yamaoka lived in the apartment for four years, it doesn’t address how\nlong someone can beneficially live in a home surrounded by fanciful features or whether doing so can be sustained. Choice\nB is incorrect. Although the text mentions the potential benefits of living in a home with disorienting design features, it\ndoesn’t suggest that this is the most effective method to create a physically stimulating environment. Choice C is incorrect\nbecause the text refers to Yamaoka to support the claim that Gins and Arakawa’s apartment building design may be\nbeneficial, but the text doesn’t indicate that Yamaoka supports the designs of other conceptual artists.\n\nQuestion Difficulty: Medium",

Johnson collected “ephemera,” or things that are meant to be thrown away. Scholars thought\nhis collection was worthless to them, then later realized that it was potentially valuable. This suggests that scholars went\nfrom disregarding ephemera to recognizing their usefulness.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text tells us that the Bodleian Library acquired Johnson's large\ncollection of ephemera back in 1968, so we can assume that contemporary historians conducting research there do have\naccess to that collection. Choice B is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text tells us that “Oxford University's\nBodleian Library acquired the collection,” but it never suggests that it was a challenge to do so. Choice C is incorrect. This\ninference isn’t supported. The text actually suggests the opposite: the example of Johnson's collection lends support to\narguments that ephemera does hold value for scholars.\n\nQuestion Difficulty: Medium",

Audience members, who wander through\nthe labyrinthine venue at their own pace and follow the actors as they play out simultaneous, interweaving narrative loops,\nconfront the impossibility of experiencing the production in its entirety. The play's refusal of narrative coherence thus hinges\non the sense of spatial fragmentation that the venue’s immense and intricate layout generates.\n\nWhat does the text most strongly suggest about Sleep No More's use of its performance space?\n\nThe choice of a New York City venue likely enabled the play's creators to experiment with the use of theatrical space in a\nA. way that venues from earlier productions could not.\n\nAudience members likely find the experience of the play disappointing because they generally cannot make their way\nB. through the entire venue.\n\nThe production's dependence on a particular performance environment would likely make it difficult to reproduce exactly\nC. in a different theatrical space.\n\nAudience members who navigate the space according to a recommended itinerary will likely have a better grasp of the\nD. play’s narrative than audience members who depart from that itinerary.\n\nID: ed314256 Answer\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nRationale\n\nChoice C is the best answer.

Some people criticized pachuca style, saying it was dangerous and women should dress traditionally.\nBut historians see things differently.

The text first describes the distinctive pachuca style of dress adopted by some Mexican American women during\nWorld War Il, saying that some criticized it and asserted that women should dress traditionally. The text then goes on to\ncontrast this position with that of historians, who \"see things differently\": according to these historians, the pachuca style\nshowed a wish for freedom and self-expression, and it acted as a kind of rebellion against what society expected of women\nat the time.
