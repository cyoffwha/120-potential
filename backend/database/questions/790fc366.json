    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. This choice uses a semicolon to join two independent clauses (\"Nakalembe doesn't just&hellip;though\" and \"she also shares...\"). This choice also appropriately includes \"though\" in the first clause, where it logically belongs.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice results in a grammar error called a comma splice. It incorrectly joins two independent clauses with only a comma instead of a comma and a coordinating conjunction like \"and\" or \"but.\" \"Though\" is a transition word, but it's not a coordinating conjunction.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error. A semicolon can only be used to link two independent clauses. However, if \"though\" is included in the second clause, it turns the second clause into a dependent clause, so a semicolon can't be used after \"information.\"",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a grammar error called a comma splice. It incorrectly joins two independent clauses with only a comma instead of a comma and a coordinating conjunction like \"and\" or \"but.\""
