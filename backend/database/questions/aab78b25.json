  "correct_answer": "D",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. This sentence is a statement: \"Moskowitz was hired by a soda company to determine how much artificial sweetener most people prefer in a diet drink.\" So a period is the most appropriate punctuation mark.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This doesn't complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. This sentence is not a question—it's a statement. So a question mark is not the appropriate punctuation.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This doesn't complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. We already have the verbs \"was hired&hellip;to determine\" in this sentence. The verb \"do\" is not needed and results in a confusing, ungrammatical sentence.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. This doesn't complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. This sentence is not a question—it's a statement. So a question mark is not the appropriate punctuation."
