<p>Despite its beautiful prose, <em>The Guns of August</em>, Barbara Tuchman&rsquo;s 1962 analysis of the start of World War I, has certain weaknesses as a work of history. It fails to address events in Eastern Europe just before the outbreak of hostilities, thereby giving the impression that Germany was the war&rsquo;s principal instigator. Had Tuchman consulted secondary works available to her by scholars such as Luigi Albertini, she would not have neglected the influence of events in Eastern Europe on Germany&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span role="heading" aria-level="2">Text 2</span></strong></p>
<p>Barbara Tuchman&rsquo;s <em>The Guns of August </em>is an engrossing if dated introduction to World War I. Tuchman&rsquo;s analysis of primary documents is laudable, but her main thesis that European powers committed themselves to a catastrophic outcome by refusing to deviate from military plans developed prior to the conflict is implausibly reductive.</p></div>
