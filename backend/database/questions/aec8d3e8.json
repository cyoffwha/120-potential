  "passage": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: Chemical leavening agents cause carbon dioxide to be released within a liquid batter, making the batter rise as it bakes. Baking soda and baking powder are chemical leavening agents. Baking soda is pure sodium bicarbonate. To produce carbon dioxide, baking soda needs to be mixed with liquid and an acidic ingredient such as honey. Baking powder is a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and an acid. To produce carbon dioxide, baking powder needs to be mixed with liquid but not with an acidic ingredient. The student wants to emphasize a difference between baking soda and baking powder. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes a difference between baking soda and baking powder, noting that baking soda needs to be mixed with an acidic ingredient to produce carbon dioxide but baking powder doesn't.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. The sentence focuses on what bakers use to make batters rise; it doesn't emphasize a difference between baking soda and baking powder.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. The sentence provides a general description of baking soda and baking powder; it doesn't emphasize a difference between them.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. The sentence explains what baking soda and honey are; it doesn't emphasize a difference between baking soda and baking powder."
