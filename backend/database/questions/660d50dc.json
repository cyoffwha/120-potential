    "In addition,",
    "Actually,",
    "However,",
    "Regardless,"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. \"In addition\" logically signals that the detail in this sentence—that Coleridge-Taylor included traditional African music in his classical compositions—adds to the information in the previous sentence. Specifically, the previous sentence indicates one way in which Coleridge-Taylor emphasized his mixed-race ancestry, and the claim that follows indicates a second, additional way.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because \"actually\" illogically signals that the detail in this sentence is surprising in light of the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the detail adds to the information, indicating a second, additional way in which Coleridge-Taylor emphasized his mixed-race ancestry.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because \"however\" illogically signals that the detail in this sentence contrasts with the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the detail adds to the information, indicating a second, additional way in which Coleridge-Taylor emphasized his mixed-race ancestry.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because \"regardless\" illogically signals that the detail in this sentence is true despite the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the detail adds to the information, indicating a second, additional way in which Coleridge-Taylor emphasized his mixed-race ancestry."
