    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. There are two independent clauses in the sentence, each with a subject and a verb: \"many...were skeptical\" and \"historians have determined&hellip;.\" These clauses can be grammatically joined by a comma and the coordinating conjunction \"but.\"",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence, which occurs when two independent clauses are joined without punctuation. Two independent clauses can't be joined by just the coordinating conjunction \"but.\" A comma would also be required.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error called a comma splice. This sentence contains two independent clauses (\"Many&hellip;were skeptical\" and \"historians have determined&hellip;\"). A comma alone can't join two independent clauses. That requires a comma and a coordinating conjunction.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence, which occurs when two independent clauses are joined without punctuation. This sentence contains two independent clauses (\"Many&hellip;were skeptical\" and \"historians have determined&hellip;\"), which need to be either joined by a semicolon, joined by a comma and a coordinating conjunction, or separated by a period."
