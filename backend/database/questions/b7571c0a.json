    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. The first sentence tells us that practical effects are more realistic but also more expensive than CGI. The second sentence tells us that many filmmakers use both kinds of effects, balancing realism with cost. To connect these ideas, we need a cause-and-effect transition, like \"therefore.\" \"For this reason\" has the same meaning as \"therefore.\" .",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This isn't a logical transition. The first sentence tells us that practical effects are more realistic but also more expensive than CGI. The second sentence tells us that many filmmakers use both kinds of effects, balancing realism with cost. To connect these ideas, we need a cause-and-effect transition, like \"therefore.\" \"Similarly\" doesn't show cause and effect: it shows the addition of another agreeing idea.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. This isn't a logical transition. The first sentence tells us that practical effects are more realistic but also more expensive than CGI. The second sentence tells us that many filmmakers use both kinds of effects, balancing realism with cost. To connect these ideas, we need a cause-and-effect transition, like \"therefore.\" \"Furthermore\" doesn't show cause and effect: it shows the addition of another agreeing idea.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This isn't a logical transition. The first sentence tells us that practical effects are more realistic but also more expensive than CGI. The second sentence tells us that many filmmakers use both kinds of effects, balancing realism with cost. To connect these ideas, we need a cause-and-effect transition, like \"therefore.\" \"In other words\" doesn't show cause and effect: it shows a restatement of the same idea in different words."
