    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of independent clauses within a sentence. An independent clause is a phrase containing a subject and a verb that can stand on its own as a sentence. This choice uses a comma and the coordinating conjunction \"but\" to join the first independent clause (\"underlines&hellip;lower a book's value\") and the second independent clause (\"such markings&hellip;can be a gold mine to scholars\") to create a compound sentence.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two independent clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can't be used in this way to mark the boundary between two independent clauses.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because a comma is needed to mark the boundary between two coordinated independent clauses."
