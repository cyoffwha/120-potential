                	<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of volunteering. The text asserts that volunteering benefits both the community in which one volunteers and society as a whole. It then states that in a survey of young people, a majority of respondents said that volunteering helps individuals, but only 6% of respondents said that volunteering helps society as a whole. If volunteering does in fact help society as a whole, as the text says, but only 6% of young people believe it does, then it&rsquo;s reasonable to conclude that volunteering is more helpful than many young people think it is.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses young people&rsquo;s beliefs about the benefits of volunteering, not where young people believe they are able to volunteer. Nothing in the text suggests that many young people believe they are only able to volunteer in their own communities. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that volunteering is beneficial for society as a whole, nothing in the text suggests that volunteering can benefit society more than it can benefit individual people. The text doesn&rsquo;t compare the benefits to society with the benefits to individuals.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text discusses young people&rsquo;s beliefs about the benefits of volunteering, not how to find volunteering opportunities. There&rsquo;s nothing in the text to suggest that many young people don&rsquo;t know how to volunteer.&nbsp;</p>
