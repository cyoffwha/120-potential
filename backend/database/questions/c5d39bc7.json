  "answer_rationales": {
    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is pronoun-antecedent agreement. The plural reflexive pronoun \"themselves\" agrees in number with the plural antecedent \"turtle barnacles,\" correctly indicating what is attached to a sea turtle shell.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because the singular pronoun \"it\" doesn't agree in number with the plural antecedent \"turtle barnacles.\"",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because it results in an unclear and confusing sentence. In this context, it's unclear what the plural pronoun \"them\" refers to.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because the singular reflexive pronoun \"itself\" doesn't agree in number with the plural antecedent \"turtle barnacles.\""
