    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. \"For instance\" logically signals that the details in this sentence—that Mexican conductor Alondra de la Parra and Colombian conductor Lina Gonzalez-Granados took new conducting positions—are examples supporting the previous claim about the new generation of artists.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because \"in addition\" illogically signals that the details in this sentence about de la Parra and Gonzalez-Granados are merely additional facts related to the previous claim about the new generation of artists. Instead, they are examples supporting that claim.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because \"lastly\" illogically signals that the details in this sentence about de la Parra and Gonzalez-Granados are the last step or a concluding summary of the previous claim about the new generation of artists. Instead, they are examples supporting that claim.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because \"granted\" illogically signals that the details in this sentence about de la Parra and Gonzalez-Granados are exceptions to the previous claim about the new generation of artists. Instead, they are examples supporting that claim."
