                	<p>Choice D is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text&rsquo;s discussion of the challenge researchers face when studying the effects of holding elected office on a person&rsquo;s behavior. The text explains that it&rsquo;s hard for researchers to test for the effects that elected office has on people because finding people to serve as a control group is difficult. The text indicates that a control group needs to be made up of people who share characteristics of the group being tested but don&rsquo;t have the variable being tested (in this case, holding elected office). Because researchers aren&rsquo;t able to influence who wins elections, they&rsquo;re also unable to determine who would serve as an appropriately similar member of a control group. Thus, it logically follows that researchers will find it difficult to identify a group of people who can function as an appropriate control group for their studies. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on the struggle to put together a control group for experiments; it doesn&rsquo;t suggest that finding information about politicians&rsquo; behavior is difficult.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because the experiments mentioned in the text are testing the effects of holding elected office on a person&rsquo;s behavior. Studying people who have already held elected office wouldn&rsquo;t provide an opportunity to note any behavioral changes that the position might cause.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the text defines people in a control group as those &ldquo;who are otherwise similar to the office-holders&rdquo;; selecting people who differ from the office-holders wouldn&rsquo;t fit the criteria for an appropriate control group.&nbsp;</p>
