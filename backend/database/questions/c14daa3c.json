  "passage": "Close analysis of the painting Girl with a Flute, long attributed to the seventeenth-century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer, has revealed subtle deviations from the artist's signature techniques. These variations suggest that the work may be that of a student under Vermeer's tutelageâ€”potentially ______ blank our understanding of Vermeer as a solitary artist.",

    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. \"Negating\" means \"reversing\" or \"making invalid.\" Proving that Vermeer worked with students would reverse the view of him as a solitary artist.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. \"Prefiguring\" means \"being an early indicator of.\" There already existed views of Vermeer as a solitary painter, so a new painting would not be an early indicator of those views. Rather, a painting proving that Vermeer had a student would contradict those earlier views.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. \"Entrenching\" means \"solidifying.\" A painting proving that Vermeer had a student would not solidify views of him as solitary, but would rather contradict those views.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. \"Substantiating\" means \"supporting with proof.\" A painting proving that Vermeer had a student would not support views of him as solitary, but would rather contradict those views."
