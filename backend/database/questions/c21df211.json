Theaters were fitted with specialized vents that emitted odors at specific points in a ______ blank as the scent of roses when roses appeared in a scene. Smell-O-Vision failed to impress, however, with one reviewer declaring it \"briefly weird and not very interesting.\"",

    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. The comma appropriately separates the nonessential descriptive aside \"such as&hellip;scene\" from the independent clause \"Theaters were&hellip;movie.\" Since the descriptive example of roses isn't necessary for the sentence to function, it needs to be set off with punctuation.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence. Since the example of roses isn't necessary for the sentence to function, the descriptive aside \"such as&hellip;scene\" needs to be separated from the preceding independent clause with some sort of punctuation.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. A semicolon can only be used to separate two independent clauses, but \"such&hellip;scene\" is not an independent clause and couldn't stand on its own as a sentence.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a sentence fragment. The descriptive aside \"Such&hellip;scene\" is not an independent clause and can't stand on its own as a sentence."
