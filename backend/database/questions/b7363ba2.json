    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. The conventions being tested are the use of possessive determiners and plural nouns. The singular possessive determiner \"its\" and the plural noun \"wings\" correctly indicate that the butterfly has multiple wings.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because the context requires the plural noun \"wings,\" not the plural possessive noun \"wings'.\"",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because the context requires the singular possessive determiner \"its\" and the plural noun \"wings,\" not the contraction \"it's\" and the singular possessive noun \"wing's.\"",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because the context requires the singular possessive determiner \"its\" and the plural noun \"wings,\" not the contraction \"it's\" and the plural possessive noun \"wings'.\""
