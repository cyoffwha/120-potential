  "passage": "In the late 1960s, inspired in part by the sight of laundry hanging on a clothesline, African American abstract painter Sam Gilliam began to create his iconic \"Drape\" paintings. He applied bold, saturated hues to large canvases and ______ blank them from ceilings or walls, causing the drooping fabric to cascade in dramatic loops and curves.",

    "to have suspended",

  ],
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. The past tense of \"suspended\" matches the past tense of \"applied,\" which has the same subject (\"he\") and takes place in the same context: \"He applied&hellip;and [he] suspended.\"",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. The perfect infinitive \"to have suspended\" doesn't match the past tense of \"applied,\" and it can't serve as a verb on its own. These are both verbs with the same subject and in the same context, so there's no need to shift tenses.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. The present participle \"suspending\" doesn't match the past tense of \"applied,\" and it can't serve as a verb on its own. These are both verbs with the same subject and in the same context, so there's no need to shift tenses.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. The infinitive \"to suspend\" doesn't match the past tense of \"applied,\" and it can't serve as a verb on its own. These are both verbs with the same subject and in the same context, so there's no need to shift tenses."
