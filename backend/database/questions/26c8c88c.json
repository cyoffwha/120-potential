    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. This choice uses a comma to correctly separate the dependent clause \"although&hellip;asteroids\" from the independent clause \"several hundred have been&hellip;Mars.\"",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a sentence fragment. \"Although&hellip;asteroids\" is a dependent clause. It can't stand on its own as a sentence, which means it can't end in a period.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error. \"Although&hellip;asteroids\" is a dependent clause and can't be joined to the independent clause \"several hundred have been&hellip;Mars\" with a semicolon. A semicolon can only join two independent clauses.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. A colon can only come after an independent clause, but \"although&hellip;asteroids\" is a dependent clause."
