  "passage": "Disco remains one of the most ridiculed popular music genres of the late twentieth century. But as scholars have argued, the genre is far less superficial than many people believe. Take the case of disco icon Donna Summer: she may have been associated with popular songs about love and heartbreak (subjects hardly unique to disco, by the way), but like many Black women singers before her, much of her music also reflects concerns about community and identity. These concerns are present in many of the genre's greatest songs, and they generally don't require much digging to reveal.",
  "question_text": "What does the text most strongly suggest about the disco genre?",
  "answer_options": [
    "It has been unjustly ignored by most scholars despite the importance of the themes addressed by many of the genre&rsquo;s songs.",
    "It evolved over time from a superficial genre focused on romance to a genre focused on more serious concerns.",
    "It has been unfairly dismissed for the inclusion of subject matter that is also found in other musical genres.",
    "It gave rise to a Black women&rsquo;s musical tradition that has endured even though the genre itself faded in the late twentieth century."
  ],
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. The text argues that disco is \"far less superficial\" than its popular perception might indicate, and that love and heartbreak are \"subjects hardly unique to disco.\"",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This choice conflicts with the text, which says that scholars argue that disco \"is far less superficial than many people believe.\"",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice says the opposite of what the text suggests. The writer argues that the genre is not as superficial as commonly believed, but that it always reflected \"concerns about community and identity.\"",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn't support this choice. There's nothing in the text about disco giving rise to an enduring Black women's musical tradition."
