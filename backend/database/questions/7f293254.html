Regardless of the reasons, art collectives usually involve some collaboration among the artists.

                	<p>Choice A is the best answer because it presents the quotation that best illustrates the journalist&rsquo;s claim.

Choice C is incorrect because the quotation highlights the support and encouragement of individual expression an artist experiences due to working in a collective; these positive aspects don&rsquo;t demonstrate the challenge of sharing control among members of a collective. Choice D is incorrect because the quotation doesn&rsquo;t address any challenges of sharing control among members of a collective; it simply indicates that artists sometimes choose to work with collectives without having to be a member.
