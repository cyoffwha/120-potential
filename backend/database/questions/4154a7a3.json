    "However,",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. \"Later\" logically signals that the event discussed in this sentence—the creation of the short film featuring Fuller's dance—is a related event that occurred after the event discussed in the previous sentence (the 1891 debut of the dance).",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because \"however\" illogically signals that the information in this sentence contrasts with the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the creation of the short film is a related event that followed the event discussed in the previous sentence.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because \"in conclusion\" illogically signals that the information in this sentence concludes or summarizes the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the creation of the short film is a related event that followed the event discussed in the previous sentence.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because \"in other words\" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a paraphrase or restatement of the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the creation of the short film is a related event that followed the event discussed in the previous sentence."
