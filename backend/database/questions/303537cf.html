                        <div><p>The following text is adapted from Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s 1889 satirical novel <em>Sylvie and Bruno</em>. A crowd has gathered outside a room belonging to the Warden, an official who reports to the Lord Chancellor.</p>
<div style="padding-left:1em"><p>One man, who was more excited than the rest, flung his hat high into the air, and shouted (as well as I could make out) &ldquo;Who roar for the Sub-Warden?&rdquo; Everybody roared, but whether it was for the Sub-Warden, or not, did not clearly appear: some were shouting &ldquo;Bread!&rdquo; and some &ldquo;Taxes!&rdquo;, but no one seemed to know what it was they really wanted.</p>
<p>All this I saw from the open window of the Warden&rsquo;s breakfast-saloon, looking across the shoulder of the Lord Chancellor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it all mean?&rdquo; he kept repeating to himself. &ldquo;I never heard such shouting before&mdash;and at this time of the morning, too! And with such unanimity!&rdquo;</p></div></div>

                	<p>Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about how the Lord Chancellor responds to the crowd that is supported by the text. The text indicates that the people in the crowd are roaring and shouting &ldquo;Bread!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Taxes!&rdquo; and presents them as not knowing what they really want. The Lord Chancellor&rsquo;s response is to ask what their shouting means but also to observe that they&rsquo;re shouting with &ldquo;unanimity,&rdquo; or total agreement. Clearly, this isn&rsquo;t the case, which supports the statement that the Lord Chancellor describes the crowd as being united even though it&rsquo;s not.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it isn&rsquo;t supported by the text. Although the text indicates that the Lord Chancellor asks about the meaning of the crowd&rsquo;s shouting, it doesn&rsquo;t suggest that he knows what the crowd really wants. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the Lord Chancellor wants to speak to the crowd. Furthermore, the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the crowd wants to hear from the Sub-Warden. Although the crowd roars when asked &ldquo;Who roar for the Sub-Warden?&rdquo; it&rsquo;s unclear what the roaring means. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the Lord Chancellor knows of or sympathizes with the crowd&rsquo;s demands. In addition, the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the crowd&rsquo;s shouting annoys the Lord Chancellor, just that it causes him to keep repeating &ldquo;What can it all mean?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
