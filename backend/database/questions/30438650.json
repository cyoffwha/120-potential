  "answer_rationales": {
    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. \"Likewise\" is a transition that indicates the addition of a new but related idea. In this sentence, the author is providing another similar example to that discussed in the previous sentence. Therefore, \"likewise\" works best in this context.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that means \"admittedly.\" But the text isn't admitting or conceding anything here. Instead, these two examples work together to support the claim made in the first sentence.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn't make sense here. The second story is not an example of the story in the previous sentenceâ€”it's another, similar story. And while both stories exemplify the first sentence in the text, the transition we're looking for isn't actually connected to that sentence.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn't make sense here. The first story didn't result in the events of the second story."
