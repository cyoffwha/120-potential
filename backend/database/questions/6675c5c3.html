                        <div><p>The following text is from Shyam Selvadurai&rsquo;s 1994 novel <em>Funny Boy. </em>The seven-year-old narrator lives with his family in Sri Lanka. Radha Aunty is the narrator&rsquo;s aunt.</p>
<p>Radha Aunty, who was the youngest in my father&rsquo;s family, had left for America four years ago when I was three, and I could not remember what she looked like. I went into the corridor to look at the family photographs that were hung there. But all the pictures were old ones, taken when Radha Aunty was a baby or young girl. Try as I might, I couldn&rsquo;t get an idea of what she looked like now. My imagination, however, was quick to fill in this void.</p>
