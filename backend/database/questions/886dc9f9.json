  "answer_rationales": {
    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period after \"Bay\" is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (\"On&hellip;Bay\") and another sentence that begins with a supplementary phrase (\"Having&hellip;years\"). Here, the supplementary phrase beginning with \"having\" modifies the subject of the second sentence, \"the celebrated ship.\"",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. Without a comma preceding it, the conjunction \"and\" can't be used in this way to join sentences.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can't be used in this way to join two sentences.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences (\"On&hellip;Bay\" and \"having&hellip;years\") are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction."
