  "answer_rationales": {
    "C": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Olga Tokarczuk's novel The Books of Jacob . As used in this context, \"complexity\" means having many complicated parts that when taken as a whole are difficult to follow or explain. The text indicates that The Books of Jacob has a large cast of characters, a complicated and wandering plot (that is, a plot that is difficult to follow), and reverse page numbering. Together, these features make up a novel that's challenging to read and summarize. This context supports the idea that a brief book review can't do justice to the novel's complexity.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. Although the word \"accuracy,\" or being free from error or falsehood, can sometimes be used to describe a novel, the text doesn't discuss whether Tokarczuk's novel has this quality. Instead, the text describes the novel as having a large cast of characters, a difficult-to-follow plot, and reverse page numbering. These features suggest complexity, not accuracy.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because \"inactivity\" means being in a state of idleness or doing nothing, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text describes Tokarczuk's novel, and although it's possible the novel could portray its characters as inactive, it wouldn't make sense to describe the novel itself as such.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because in this context \"restraint\" would mean holding back or showing self-control, and the text doesn't indicate that Tokarczuk's novel has either of these qualities. In fact, the features of the novel that the text describes, such as a large cast of characters, a complicated and wandering plot, and reverse page numbering, suggest excess and complexity, not restraint."
