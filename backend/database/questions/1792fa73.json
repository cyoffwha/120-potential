  "passage": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: The tundra is a type of environment characterized by especially harsh winter conditions. Winter temperatures in the tundra average a frigid &minus;30 negative 30 degrees Fahrenheit. Animals that have adapted to these conditions can survive tundra winters. During the tundra's short growing season, average temperatures can reach a relatively mild 54 degrees Fahrenheit. Around 1,700 different kinds of plants are able to grow in the tundra. The student wants to emphasize how harsh the conditions can be in the tundra. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes how harsh the conditions in the tundra can be, noting that the winters are especially harsh and describing the average temperatures as \"frigid.\"",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because the sentence explains that some animals can survive harsh tundra winters; it doesn't emphasize how harsh the conditions can be.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because the sentence specifies how many different kinds of plants can live in the tundra; it doesn't emphasize how harsh the conditions in the tundra can be.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because the sentence explains that both plants and animals can survive in the tundra; it doesn't emphasize how harsh the conditions in the tundra can be."
