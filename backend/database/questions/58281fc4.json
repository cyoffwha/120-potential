    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. The sentence effectively describes Unwoven Light to an audience unfamiliar with Park, noting that Soo Sunny Park is a Korean American artist and that the 2013 work consists of colorful prisms formed by light passing through iridescent tiles.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. The sentence describes aspects of Unwoven Light but doesn't mention who Park is; it thus doesn't effectively describe the work to an audience unfamiliar with Park.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. Although the sentence indicates when the work was created and who Park is, it lacks descriptive details and thus doesn't effectively describe Unwoven Light .",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. The sentence mentions Park and describes an aspect of Unwoven Light —the chain-link fence—but doesn't effectively describe the overall work to an audience unfamiliar with the artist."
