  "correct_answer": "C",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. The subject of the modifier \"fortifying soil in arid ecosystems against erosion\" is \"biocrusts.\" Subject-modifier placement requires a modifier and its subject to be next to each other, so \"biocrusts\" or some variant meaning \"biocrusts\" (in this case, \"these crusts\") must begin the missing clause.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The subject of the modifier \"fortifying soil in arid ecosystems against erosion\" is \"biocrusts,\" not \"a recent study's estimate.\"",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The subject of the modifier \"fortifying soil in arid ecosystems against erosion\" is \"biocrusts,\" not \"an estimated 60 percent reduction.\"",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The subject of the modifier \"fortifying soil in arid ecosystems against erosion\" is \"biocrusts,\" not \"a recent study.\""
