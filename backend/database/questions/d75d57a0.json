    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation between a subordinate clause and a main clause. This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the subordinate clause (\"While&hellip;lifelike\") and the main clause (\"others look to the past\").",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because it results in an incomplete sentence with no main clause.",
