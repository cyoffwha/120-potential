                	<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation from <em>King Lear</em> to illustrate the claim that King Lear expresses regret for his actions. In the quotation, Lear describes striking himself on the head&mdash;the same act he&rsquo;s engaged in as he speaks, and one that suggests he&rsquo;s deeply upset with himself. Referring to himself in the second person (with &ldquo;thy&rdquo;), the character exclaims &ldquo;Beat at this gate that let thy folly in / And thy dear judgement out!&rdquo; Lear refers metaphorically to his own mind as a gate that has allowed folly, or poor judgement, to enter and good judgement to escape. This suggests that Lear regrets his attempts to test his three daughters&rsquo; devotion to him, regarding those attempts as examples of the folly that has entered the gate of his mind. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because this quotation doesn&rsquo;t express King Lear&rsquo;s sense of regret over his own actions; instead, it expresses his belief that the harm that others have done to him (or the extent to which they have &ldquo;sinned against&rdquo; him) outweighs whatever harm he himself has caused by &ldquo;sinning.&rdquo; Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn&rsquo;t express King Lear&rsquo;s sense of regret over his own actions; instead, it expresses his thoughts about an approaching storm (&ldquo;this tempest&rdquo;), which he believes &ldquo;will not give [him] leave to ponder,&rdquo; or time to consider, the harm that he will continue to experience (&ldquo;things&rdquo; that &ldquo;would hurt [him] more&rdquo;). Choice D is incorrect because this quotation expresses King Lear&rsquo;s vow to commit terrible actions (or &ldquo;things&rdquo; that &ldquo;shall be / The terrors of the earth&rdquo;) in the future, not his regret over actions that he&rsquo;s already taken. </p>
