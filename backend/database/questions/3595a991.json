  "answer_rationales": {
    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is pronoun&ndash;antecedent agreement. The plural pronoun \"they\" agrees in number with the plural antecedent \"woodcuts\" and clearly identifies what was exhibited at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because the singular pronoun \"it\" doesn't agree in number with the plural antecedent \"woodcuts.\"",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because the singular pronoun \"this\" doesn't agree in number with the plural antecedent \"woodcuts.\"",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because the plural pronoun \"some\" is illogical in this context (referring to \"some\" of two woodcuts)."
