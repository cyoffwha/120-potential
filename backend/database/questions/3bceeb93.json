  "passage": "When they were first discovered in Australia in 1798, duck-billed, beaver-tailed platypuses so defied categorization that one scientist assigned them the name Ornithorhynchus paradoxus : \"paradoxical bird-snout.\" The animal, which lays eggs but also nurses ______ blank young with milk, has since been classified as belonging to the monotremes group.",

    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. The singular possessive pronoun \"its\" agrees with the singular antecedent \"the animal\" and indicates that the \"young\" belong to it.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a pronoun-antecedent agreement error. \"They're\" is a contraction of \"they are,\" a plural pronoun and verb, but the antecedent \"the animal\" is singular. Also, we don't need the extra verb \"are\" â€” we already have a main verb in this clause, so adding \"are\" would be confusing and ungrammatical.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a pronoun-antecedent agreement error. \"Their\" is a plural pronoun, but the subject of the sentence is \"the animal,\" a singular noun.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a confusing and ungrammatical sentence. \"It's\" is a contraction for \"it is.\" We already have the verb \"nurses\" in this clause, so we shouldn't add the verb \"is.\""
