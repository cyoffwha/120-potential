  "answer_rationales": {
    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between a name and title and between a subject and a verb. No punctuation is needed between the proper noun \"Heather Grab\" and \"entomologist,\" the title that describes Grab. Additionally, no punctuation is needed between the sentence's subject (\"Entomologist Heather Grab\") and the main verb (\"found\") that indicates what Grab did.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the subject and the verb.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because no punctuation is needed. Setting the entomologist's name off with commas suggests that it could be removed without affecting the coherence of the sentence, which isn't the case.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the subject and the verb."
