<p>Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s 1928 novel <em>Orlando </em>is an oddity within her body of work. Her other major novels consist mainly of scenes of everyday life and describe their characters&rsquo; interior states in great detail, whereas <em>Orlando </em>propels itself through a series of fantastical events and considers its characters&rsquo; psychology more superficially. Woolf herself sometimes regarded the novel as a minor work, even admitting once that she &ldquo;began it as a joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span role="heading" aria-level="2"><strong>Text 2</strong></span></p>
<p>Like Woolf&rsquo;s other great novels, <em>Orlando </em>portrays how people&rsquo;s memories inform their experience of the present. Like those works, it examines how people navigate social interactions shaped by gender and social class. Though it is lighter in tone&mdash;more entertaining, even&mdash;this literary &ldquo;joke&rdquo; nonetheless engages seriously with the themes that motivated the four or five other novels by Woolf that have achieved the status of literary classics.</p></div>

                	<p>Choice C is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the assessment of <em>Orlando </em>in Text 1. Both authors agree that <em>Orlando </em>is unusual for Woolf: Text 1 states that the novel examines its characters&rsquo; psychologies more superficially than Woolf&rsquo;s other novels do, and Text 2 describes it as being lighter in tone. However, while Text 1 calls <em>Orlando </em>an &ldquo;oddity&rdquo; and mentions that Woolf &ldquo;began it as a joke,&rdquo; Text 2 asserts that <em>Orlando </em>engages the same themes as Woolf&rsquo;s other great novels. Hence, the author of Text 2 would most likely accept that <em>Orlando </em>differs from Woolf&rsquo;s other novels but would also insist on its importance in the context of Woolf&rsquo;s work as a writer. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Text 2 does suggest that the humor in <em>Orlando </em>is effective. However, there&rsquo;s nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the author would agree that Woolf&rsquo;s talents were best suited to serious novels. Rather, the author of Text 2 compares <em>Orlando </em>favorably to other novels by Woolf that are implied to be darker in tone. Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 does not indicate that <em>Orlando </em>is less impressive than Woolf&rsquo;s other novels, but instead points out that it engages the same themes as other novels by Woolf that are considered classics. Choice D is incorrect because there&rsquo;s nothing in Text 1 or Text 2 to suggest that readers have generally ignored <em>Orlando </em>because of its reputation. </p>
