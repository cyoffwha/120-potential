                	<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text.

Although the text mentions that Smart-Grosvenor worked in national public television and radio and was a food writer, these details aren&rsquo;t the main focus. Rather than focusing on Smart-Grosvenor&rsquo;s various jobs, the text focuses specifically on one specific book she wrote. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text suggests that <em>Vibration Cooking: or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl </em>was groundbreaking, it doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the book didn&rsquo;t receive praise when it was published. In fact, the text states that the book is &ldquo;long admired.&rdquo;&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text states that Smart-Grosvenor was a culinary anthropologist and that her book influenced later approaches to food writing but doesn&rsquo;t indicate that Smart-Grosvenor or her book influenced people to begin cooking for themselves. </p>
