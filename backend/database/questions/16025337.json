  "passage": "The following text is adapted from William Shakespeare's 1609 poem \"Sonnet 27.\" The poem is addressed to a close friend as if he were physically present. Weary with toil, I [hurry] to my bed, The dear repose for limbs with travel tired; But then begins a journey in my head To work my mind, when body's work's expired: For then my thoughts—from far where I abide— [Begin] a zealous pilgrimage to thee, And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,",
  "question_text": "What is the main idea of the text?",
  "answer_options": [
    "The speaker is asleep and dreaming about traveling to see the friend.",
    "The speaker is planning an upcoming trip to the friend&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;",
    "The speaker is too fatigued to continue a discussion with the friend.",
    "The speaker is thinking about the friend instead of immediately falling asleep."
  ],
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "D": "Choice D is the best answer it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The speaker describes going to bed for \"repose\" (rest) but finding that his thoughts are focused on the friend the speaker is addressing, and the thoughts are keeping the speaker awake.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because the speaker isn't asleep; the thoughts about the friend are keeping the speaker awake.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because the speaker isn't talking about taking a literal trip; rather, the speaker uses the metaphor of a journey to describe internal thoughts.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because the speaker isn't having a discussion with the friend."
