  "passage": "American fashion designer Patrick Kelly was known for his love of colorful buttons. Many of his signature dresses feature bold assortments of buttons throughout the garment. In a paper, a fashion design student claims that Kelly's use of buttons as decoration was inspired by his childhood observations of the styles and actions of the women in his family.",
  "question_text": "Which quotation from a work by a historian would be the most effective evidence for the student to include in support of this claim?",
  "answer_options": [
    "&ldquo;Although some of the assortments of buttons appear to be mismatched pieces scattered randomly throughout Kelly&rsquo;s dresses, his most famous designs feature carefully crafted patterns of matching buttons.&rdquo;",
    "&ldquo;Many of Kelly&rsquo;s contemporaries were inspired by his designs to incorporate buttons, as well as zippers and snaps, as decorative items in their work.&rdquo;&nbsp;",
    "&ldquo;Kelly&rsquo;s grandmother, who would repair clothing when he was a child, frequently added mismatched buttons to the clothes to draw attention away from any flaws in the garments.&rdquo;",
    "&ldquo;Kelly was destined to be a designer from a young age: he learned how to sew clothing from his aunt Bertha, and his love of drawing was developed by his mother.&rdquo;"
