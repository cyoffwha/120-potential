Though maglev advocates in the US have long imagined these trains crisscrossing the country, their dream remains unrealized. ______ blank of the handful of maglev trains currently in operation, all are in Asia.",

    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. This sentence emphasizes just how far maglev advocates' dreams are from coming true. \"In fact\" is a transition used to emphasize the truth of a statement that modifies the previous statement and therefore fits perfectly in this context.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn't make sense here. Maglev advocates' dream remaining unrealized would not cause there to be only a few maglev trains, all located in Asia.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition, which doesn't make sense here. In fact, this sentence agrees with the previous sentence—both talk about how maglev trains are far from becoming common in the US.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition, which doesn't make sense here. In fact, this sentence agrees with the previous sentence—both talk about how maglev trains are far from becoming common in the US."
