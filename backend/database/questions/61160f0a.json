    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verb forms within a sentence. The nonfinite present participle verb \"looking\" is correctly used to form a subordinate clause that describes the intent behind how L'Engle begins her novel.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because the finite past tense verb \"looked\" can't be used in this way to form a subordinate clause.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because the finite present tense verb \"looks\" can't be used in this way to form a subordinate clause.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because the finite present progressive tense verb \"is looking\" can't be used in this way to form a subordinate clause."
