                	<p>Choice D is the best answer because this quotation would be the most effective evidence to include in support of the claim that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and NPR were inspired by the British Broadcasting System (BBC). The quotation states that the goal of the BBC was to support British democracy and that US legislators believed high-quality programming could accomplish the same goal for democracy in the United States. In other words, US legislators looked to the BBC as a model, taking direct inspiration from it when they created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which in turn created NPR. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because this quotation provides historical information about the BBC, not information about the inspiration for the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and NPR. This quotation, therefore, is irrelevant to the student&rsquo;s claim that the BBC inspired the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which in turn created NPR. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation contrasts the lack of competition faced by the BBC with the substantial competition faced by NPR, which has no bearing on the student&rsquo;s claim that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and NPR were inspired by the BBC.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because this quotation focuses on a common belief among US politicians that inspired Congress&rsquo;s embrace of publicly funded broadcasting. The quotation doesn&rsquo;t say anything about the BBC and therefore doesn&rsquo;t support the claim that the BBC inspired Congress to create the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which in turn created NPR. </p>
