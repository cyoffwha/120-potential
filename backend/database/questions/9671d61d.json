  "passage": "The following text is from Claude McKay's 1922 poem \"Morning Joy.\" The speaker is looking out a window and observing a wold, or large area of land. At night the wide and level stretch of wold, Which at high noon had basked in quiet gold, Far as the eye could see was ghostly white; Dark was the night save for the snow's weird light. I drew the shades far down, crept into bed; Hearing the cold wind moaning overhead Through the sad pines, my soul, catching its pain, Went sorrowing with it across the plain. As used in the text, what does the word \"drew\" most nearly mean?",

  ],
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "A": "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, \"drew\" most nearly means pulled. In the text, the speaker stands at a window, looking out on a landscape at night. The speaker then \"drew the shades far down, crept into bed.\" That is, the speaker pulled down, or lowered, the shades until they were completely shut before going to sleep.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"drew\" can refer to draining or removing liquid, especially water, as when someone draws water from a well, in this context it refers to the speaker pulling down window shades for the night.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. In some contexts, \"drew\" can be used to describe how a person or thing inspires, or elicits, a response from someone, as when a performer draws applause from an audience. But in this context it refers to the speaker pulling down window shades for the night.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. Although \"drew\" has several meanings, including sketched, or illustrated with a pen or pencil, in this context it refers to the speaker pulling down window shades for the night."
