                	<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of the significance of the 2014 archaeological finding at El Algar. In this context, &ldquo;concede&rdquo; means to admit something is true after first resisting that admission. The text indicates that some researchers believe &ldquo;Bronze Age societies were ruled by men.&rdquo; But the Bronze Age burial of a woman at El Algar included &ldquo;valuable objects signaling a high position of power,&rdquo; which would raise the possibility that &ldquo;women may have also held leadership roles.&rdquo; Thus, the text is calling into question the notion that only men were leaders in these societies and speculating that people holding this view may reconsider their opinion. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because &ldquo;waive&rdquo; means to refrain from insisting that something, such as a right or a requirement, be observed; the word isn&rsquo;t used, however, in contexts where someone acknowledges that an opinion they hold may be invalid, as is the case in the text.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect. According to the text, the finding from the El Algar burial site undermines the view that Bronze Age societies were exclusively ruled by men. However, &ldquo;refute&rdquo; means to demonstrate that something is false and would not make sense in context. Lull and team&rsquo;s finding supports the view that women may have also held leadership roles, not that they did not participate in such roles. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, &ldquo;require&rdquo; means to demand or specify as mandatory. However, it would not make sense for contemporary researchers to demand that Bronze Age &ldquo;women may have also held leadership roles.&rdquo; </p>
