                        <div><p>The following text is from Edith Nesbit&rsquo;s 1902 novel <em>Five Children and It</em>. Five young siblings have just moved with their parents from London to a house in the countryside that they call the White House.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was not really a pretty house at all; it was quite ordinary, and mother thought it was rather inconvenient, and was quite annoyed at there being no shelves, to speak of, and hardly a cupboard in the place. Father used to say that the ironwork on the roof and coping was like an architect&rsquo;s nightmare. But the house was deep in the country, with no other house in sight, and the children had been in London for two years, without so much as once going to the seaside even for a day by an excursion train, and so the White House seemed to them a sort of Fairy Palace set down in an Earthly Paradise.</p>
