Such biennials are held in New York, Berlin, and Venice. In 2006, artists Ed Gomez and Luis Hernandez founded the unconventional MexiCali Biennial. The MexiCali Biennial hosts exhibitions in different venues on both sides of the US-Mexico border. The MexiCali Biennial has taken place on an uneven schedule, with exhibitions in 2006, 2009–10, 2013, and 2018–20. The student wants to emphasize a difference between the MexiCali Biennial and traditional biennials. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",

    "The term biennial traditionally refers to an art exhibition that takes place every two years in a single location, not to exhibitions hosted at a variety of times and venues.",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. The sentence effectively emphasizes a difference between the MexiCali Biennial and traditional biennials, stating that the MexiCali Biennial is unlike traditional biennials because it hosts exhibitions in different venues on an uneven schedule.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. The sentence indicates who founded the MexiCali Biennial and the years this biennial has taken place; it doesn't emphasize a difference between the MexiCali Biennial and traditional biennials.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence clarifies the traditional meaning of biennial with language that could apply to the MexiCali Biennial, it doesn't mention the MexiCali Biennial by name. Therefore, the sentence doesn't effectively emphasize a difference between the MexiCali Biennial and traditional biennials.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. The sentence notes locations where various biennial exhibitions have been held; it doesn't emphasize a difference between the MexiCali Biennial and traditional biennials."
