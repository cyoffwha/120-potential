    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. The clause \"A subseasonal&hellip;advance\" and the clause \"its predictions&hellip;forecast\" are both independent clauses, so using a semicolon to separate them is grammatically correct.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause \"A subseasonal&hellip;advance\" and the clause \"its predictions&hellip;forecast\" are both independent clauses, so a comma is not enough to separate them.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause \"A subseasonal&hellip;advance\" and the clause \"its predictions&hellip;forecast\" are both independent clauses, so they need to be separated with specific punctuation (a period, a semi-colon, a colon, a dash, or a comma + a coordinating conjunction).",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause \"A subseasonal&hellip;advance\" and the clause \"its predictions&hellip;forecast\" are both independent clauses, so the word \"and\" by itself is not enough to separate them. There would need to be a comma before \"and\" for this choice to work."
