  "answer_rationales": {
    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of punctuation between titles and proper nouns. No punctuation is needed to set off the proper noun \"Wakako Yamauchi\" from the title that describes Yamauchi, \"pioneering playwright.\" Because \"Wakako Yamauchi\" is essential information identifying the \"pioneering playwright,\" no punctuation is necessary.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because no punctuation is needed before or after the proper noun \"Wakako Yamauchi.\" Setting the playwright's name off with commas suggests that it could be removed without affecting the coherence of the sentence, which isn't the case.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the title \"pioneering playwright\" and the proper noun \"Wakako Yamauchi.\"",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the proper noun \"Wakako Yamauchi\" and the verb \"compares.\""
