    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period after \"percent\" is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (\"After&hellip;percent\") and another (\"Such&hellip;up\").",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can't be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. Without a comma preceding it, the conjunction \"and\" can't be used in this way to join sentences.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences (\"After&hellip;percent\" and \"Such&hellip;up\") are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction."
