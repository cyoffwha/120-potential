  "passage": "Logically, a damaged fossil should provide less information than an intact one, but for paleontologist Brigitte Schoenemann, a broken area on a fossilized trilobite (a crustacean-like creature) ______ blank fresh insight, allowing her to view the inner structure of the organism's eye.",
  "question_text": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
  "answer_options": [
    "resolved",
    "adjusted",
    "offered",
    "directed"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "C": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion about how, for Schoenemann, a damaged trilobite fossil was informative. In context, \"offered\" means provided or gave. The text suggests that although it may seem counterintuitive, a broken fossilized trilobite allowed Schoenemann to observe more details of the trilobite's eye than an intact fossilized trilobite would. This context conveys the idea that a damaged fossil offered, or provided, fresh insight into the structure of a trilobite's eye.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because \"resolved\" means determined or figured out, which wouldn't make sense in this context. The text focuses on how Schoenemann was able to get more information from a broken fossil than an intact one. Although the damaged fossil may have allowed her to determine certain information, as an inanimate object the fossil isn't capable of resolving anything.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because saying that the broken part of a trilobite fossil \"adjusted,\" or changed or modified, fresh insight wouldn't make sense in this context. The text focuses on how Schoenemann was able to get more information from a broken fossil than an intact one. This context suggests that the fossil offered fresh insight, or understanding, not that it adjusted fresh insight.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because \"directed\" means managed or instructed, which wouldn't make sense in this context. The text focuses on how Schoenemann was able to get more information from a broken fossil than an intact one. This context suggests that the fossil offered fresh insight, or understanding, not that it directed fresh insight."
