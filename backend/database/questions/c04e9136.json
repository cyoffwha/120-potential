    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. This choice correctly uses a semicolon to punctuate a complex list (which is made up of items that have commas in them).",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This is a complex list, indicated by the semicolon between \"1998\" and \"Carolyn Bertozzi.\" What comes after the blank is a separate list item, so punctuation is needed after \"Stanford.\"",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This is a complex list, indicated by the semicolon between \"1998\" and \"Carolyn Bertozzi.\" The items in this list have internal punctuation in the form of commas and must therefore be separated by semicolons to avoid confusion.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. This is a complex list, indicated by the semicolon between \"1998\" and \"Carolyn Bertozzi.\" Colons aren't used to separate items in a list."
