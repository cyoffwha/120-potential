  "answer_rationales": {
    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. \"However\" logically signals that the information in this sentence—that Hammurabi is mainly remembered for just a single achievement, the Code of Hammurabi—is contrary to what might be assumed from the previous information about Hammurabi's many achievements.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because \"therefore\" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a result of the previous information about Hammurabi's many achievements. Instead, this sentence makes a point that is contrary to what might be assumed from the previous information.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because \"likewise\" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is similar to the previous information about Hammurabi's many achievements. Instead, this sentence makes a point that is contrary to what might be assumed from the previous information.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because \"for instance\" illogically signals that this sentence exemplifies the previous information about Hammurabi's many achievements. Instead, this sentence makes a point that is contrary to what might be assumed from the previous information."
