  "correct_answer": "D",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. \"That&hellip;[rain] back onto Mars's surface\" is a relative clause that describes the \"bits of molten rock.\" Forming the clause requires a conjugated, finite verb, and this is the only choice that provides that.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. \"To rain\" is an infinitive and can't serve as the main verb of a clause. A conjugated verb is needed here to form the main verb of the relative clause \"that&hellip;[rain] back onto Mars's surface,\" which describes the \"bits of molten rock.\"",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. \"Raining\" is a present participle and, on its own, can't serve as the main verb of a clause. A conjugated verb is needed here to form the main verb of the relative clause \"that&hellip;[rain] back onto Mars's surface,\" which describes the \"bits of molten rock.\"",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. \"Having rained\" is a perfect participle and can't serve as the main verb of a clause. A conjugated verb is needed here to form the main verb of the relative clause \"that&hellip;[rain] back onto Mars's surface,\" which describes the \"bits of molten rock.\""
