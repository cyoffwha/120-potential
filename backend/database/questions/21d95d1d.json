  "question_text": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
  "answer_options": [
    "pragmatic",
    "controversial",
    "extensive",
    "universal"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "C": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of how Ofelia Zepeda has contributed to the field of linguistics. As used in this context, \"extensive\" means having a wide or considerable extent. The text indicates that Zepeda's many accomplishments in linguistics are varied, including teaching linguistics, writing poetry in more than one language, creating a grammar book, and co-founding a language institute. This context supports the idea that Zepeda's contributions to the field are extensive.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because the sentence presents Zepeda's accomplishments as examples to support the claim made in the first part of the sentence. It wouldn't make sense to say that achievements as a professor, poet and author, and co-founder of a language institute demonstrate that Zepeda's contributions in her field are \"pragmatic,\" or related to practical matters and not involving intellectual or artistic matters.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because the sentence presents Zepeda's accomplishments as a professor, poet and author, and co-founder of a language institute as examples to support the claim made in the first part of the sentence. There's no reason to believe that the positive achievements listed demonstrate that Zepeda's contributions in her field are \"controversial,\" or have caused disputes and opposing viewpoints.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"universal\" would mean including or covering everything in a group. The sentence presents Zepeda's accomplishments as examples to support the claim made in the first part of the sentence, and it wouldn't make sense to say that these specific achievements—particularly as the author of a grammar book specific to the Tohono O'odham language—demonstrate that Zepeda's contributions relate to everything in the field of linguistics."
