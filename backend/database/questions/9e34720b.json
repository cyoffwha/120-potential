  "passage": "Although those who migrated to California in 1849 dreamed of finding gold nuggets in streambeds, the state's richest deposits were buried deeply in rock, beyond the reach of individual prospectors. ______ blank by 1852, many had given up their fortune-hunting dreams and gone to work for one of the large companies capable of managing California's complex mining operations.",

    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. \"Consequently\" logically signals that the information in this sentence—that many individual gold prospectors gave up their fortune-hunting dreams and became employees of mining companies—is a result or consequence of the previous information about the inaccessibility of the state's gold deposits.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because \"furthermore\" illogically signals that the information in this sentence merely adds to the previous information about the inaccessibility of the state's gold deposits. Instead, it's a result or consequence of that information.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because \"still\" illogically signals that the information in this sentence offers a contrast or exception to the previous information about the inaccessibility of the state's gold deposits. Instead, it's a result or consequence of that information.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because \"next\" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is the next step in a process. Instead, it's a result or consequence of the previous information about the inaccessibility of the state's gold deposits."
