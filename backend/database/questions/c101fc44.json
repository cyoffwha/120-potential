In the past, researchers were limited to studying the marks found on the fossilized teeth of skeletons, but in 2017 a team led by Laura Weyrich of the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA tried something ______ blank the DNA found in Neanderthals' fossilized dental plaque.",

    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. \"A team&hellip;tried something new\" is an independent clause leading to an explanation of what the new thing was. A colon can only be used at the end of an independent clause, and typically introduces further explanation that expands upon the first clause, which makes a colon the perfect choice here.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error. \"Sequencing&hellip;dental plaque\" can't stand on its own as a sentence, and so it can't be linked to the independent clause \"a team&hellip;tried something new\" with a semicolon. Only two independent clauses can be connected in this way.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error. If \"sequencing\" is included in the first clause, it can no longer stand on its own as a complete idea. Since a colon can only come at the end of an independent clause, using one in this way creates an error.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a sentence fragment. \"Sequencing&hellip;dental plaque\" can't stand on its own as a sentence."
