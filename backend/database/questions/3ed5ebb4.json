  "answer_rationales": {
    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation between a main clause and a supplementary noun phrase. This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the main clause (\"scholar&hellip;materialism\") and the supplementary noun phrase (\"an apt assessment\") that describes Waid's observation about how The House of Mirth depicts the upper classes of New York society.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because a semicolon and the conjunction \"and\" can't be used in this way to mark the boundary between a main clause and a supplementary noun phrase.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. Joining the main clause (\"scholar&hellip;materialism\") and the following noun phrase with the conjunction \"and\" results in a confusing and illogical sentence that suggests that the novel depicts the upper classes of New York society as \"an apt assessment,\" which doesn't make sense in this context.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the main clause and the supplementary noun phrase with appropriate punctuation."
