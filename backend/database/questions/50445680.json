  "passage": "In winter, the diets of Japanese macaques, also known as snow monkeys, are influenced more by food availability than by food preference. Although the monkeys prefer to eat vegetation and land-dwelling invertebrates, those food sources may become unavailable because of extensive snow and ice cover, ______ blank the monkeys to hunt for marine animals in any streams that have not frozen over.",

  ],
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of finite and nonfinite verb forms within a sentence. The nonfinite present participle \"forcing\" is correctly used to form a participial phrase that supplements the main clause \"those...cover,\" describing the effects on monkeys of the lack of food sources.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because the finite present tense verb \"forces\" can't be used in this way to supplement the main clause (\"those...cover\").",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. While the nonfinite to-infinitive \"to force\" could be used to form a subordinate clause that supplements the main clause (\"those...cover\"), to-infinitives conventionally express purpose, and nothing in the sentence suggests that the food sources become unavailable for the purpose of forcing monkeys to hunt marine animals.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because the finite past tense verb \"forced\" can't be used in this way to supplement the main clause (\"those...cover\")."
