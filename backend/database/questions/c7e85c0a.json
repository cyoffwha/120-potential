    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. \"However\" logically signals that the information in this sentence—that envelope-shaped bags dominated the market—contrasts with the previous claim that these bags were impractical for carrying goods.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because \"for instance\" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is an example supporting the previous claim that envelope-shaped bags were impractical for carrying goods. Instead, the sentence contrasts with the previous claim about the bags.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because \"thus\" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a result of the previous claim that envelope-shaped bags were impractical for carrying goods. Instead, the sentence contrasts with the previous claim about the bags.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because \"in other words\" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a paraphrase of the previous claim that envelope-shaped bags were impractical for carrying goods. Instead, the sentence contrasts with the previous claim about the bags."
