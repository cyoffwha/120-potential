    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. The second sentence describes a consequence of the system laid out in the first sentence: because air is owned and sold by companies in this world, people have to buy it.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that means \"no matter what happens\" or \"whatever the situation is,\" which doesn't make sense here. There's only one situation described in the text: a fictional world in which companies own all the breathable air, forcing people to buy it.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn't disagree with the previous sentence. They both describe the same fictional situation.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a shift back in time, which doesn't make sense here. Both sentences use the present tense, as they're describing the same fictional time period."
