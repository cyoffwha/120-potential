    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of a supplementary element within a sentence. The dash after \"Ecuador\" and the closing parenthesis pairs with the dash after \"territories\" to separate the supplementary element (\"New&hellip;Ecuador\") from the rest of the sentence. The supplementary element specifies the three South American territories that Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var liberated, and the pair of dashes indicates that this element could be removed without affecting the grammatical coherence of the sentence.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because it fails to use appropriate punctuation to separate the supplementary element from the rest of the sentence. Furthermore, punctuation isn't needed between \"Ecuador\" and the closing parenthesis.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because it fails to use appropriate punctuation to separate the supplementary element from the rest of the sentence.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because a comma can't be paired with a dash to separate the supplementary element from the rest of the sentence."
