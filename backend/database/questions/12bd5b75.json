    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is pronoun-antecedent agreement. The singular pronoun \"it\" agrees in number with the singular antecedent \"the Salt Lake Temple.\"",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because the singular pronoun \"one\" is ambiguous in this context; the resulting sentence leaves unclear whether there is only one Salt Lake temple or multiple.",
