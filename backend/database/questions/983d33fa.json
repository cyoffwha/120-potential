  "passage": "In 1637, the price of tulips skyrocketed in Amsterdam, with single bulbs of rare varieties selling for up to the equivalent of $200,000 in today's US dollars. Some historians ______ blank that this \"tulip mania\" was the first historical instance of an asset bubble, which occurs when investors drive prices to highs not supported by actual demand.",

    "claiming",

    "having claimed",
    "to claim"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of finite and nonfinite verb forms within a sentence. A main clause requires a finite verb to perform the action of the subject (in this case, \"some historians\"), and this choice supplies the finite present tense verb \"claim\" to indicate what some historians do.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because the nonfinite participle \"claiming\" doesn't supply the main clause with a finite verb.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because the nonfinite participle \"having claimed\" doesn't supply the main clause with a finite verb.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because the nonfinite to-infinitive \"to claim\" doesn't supply the main clause with a finite verb."
