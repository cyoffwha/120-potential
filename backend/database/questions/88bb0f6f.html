<p>A team led by Bernardo Strassburg has found that rewilding farmland (returning the land to its natural state) could help preserve biodiversity and offset carbon emissions. The amount of farmland that would need to be restored, they found, is remarkably low. Rewilding a mere 15% of the world&rsquo;s current farmland would prevent 60% of expected species extinctions and help absorb nearly 299 gigatons of carbon dioxide&mdash;a clear win in the fight against the biodiversity and climate crises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span role="heading" aria-level="2"><strong>Text 2</strong></span></p>
<p>While Strassburg&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s findings certainly offer encouraging insight into the potential benefits of rewilding, it&rsquo;s important to consider potential effects on global food supplies. The researchers suggest that to compensate for the loss of food-producing land, remaining farmland would need to produce even more food. Thus, policies focused on rewilding farmland must also address strategies for higher-yield farming.</p></div>
