  "answer_options": [
    "&ldquo;Very happy, he would jog home, the heavy silver pieces in his leather pockets making a discreet and dulcet &lsquo; trink-trak &rsquo; between his jugs and his body.&rdquo;",
    "&ldquo;He learned that the city   aguador   may not blow his whistle to halt the traffic while he gravely crosses the street, but must wait for the passing of many vehicles, some with horses and some outlandishly without.&rdquo;",

  ],
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "C": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim in the text that John is hard-working and dedicated to his job. In the quotation, John is portrayed as spending \"early morn to the fall of the afternoon\" working hard as a water carrier. John is also described as \"so accustomed to bending\" while doing his work \"that he never thought of straightening\" his body, instead remaining deeply focused on his work. These details portray John as a dedicated worker.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because this quotation portrays John as happy about heading home after being paid. It doesn't showcase John being hard at work.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn't pertain to John's commitment to his work; it describes difficulties the traffic in the city causes John in the performance of his work.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because this quotation doesn't pertain to John's commitment to his work; it discusses what John does with his worn-out water jugs."
