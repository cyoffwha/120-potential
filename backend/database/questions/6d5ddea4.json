  "passage": "According to Potawatomi ecologist Robin Wall Kimmerer, the Indigenous method of harvesting Hierochloe odorata , or sweetgrass, by snapping the plant off at the root actually ______ blank wild populations: it may seem counterintuitive, she says, but this method of removal allows new sweetgrass plants to repopulate the space, with an overall increase in number and vigor.",
  "question_text": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
  "answer_options": [
    "selects",
    "originates",
    "conditions",
    "replenishes"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "D": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the Indigenous method of harvesting Hierochloe odorata. As used in this context, \"replenishes\" means helps increase the population or helps it recover. The text explains that although snapping off a wild plant at the root might seem detrimental to the wild population, it actually helps Hierochloe odorata , increasing both their \"number and vigor.\" This context conveys the idea that even though it seems counterintuitive, the Indigenous method of harvesting Hierochloe odorata actually replenishes the wild population.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. Although a harvesting method could be used to select for certain traits in plants, it's not clear what it would mean for a harvesting method to select \"wild populations\" of plants.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because as used in this context, \"originates\" means creates. The text doesn't address the origin of Hierochloe odorata , but rather how the Indigenous harvesting method affects it.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"conditions\" means to influence someone or something to behave in a certain way, and the text doesn't suggest the new plants that replace the harvested ones differ in any meaningful way, or in any way that could be the result of conditioning."
