  "passage": "The following text is adapted from Robert Louis Stevenson's 1883 novel Treasure Island . Bill is a sailor staying at the Admiral Benbow, an inn run by the narrator's parents. Every day when [Bill] came back from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road. At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them. When a seaman did [stay] at the Admiral Benbow (as now and then some did) he would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was present.",
