  "correct_answer": "A",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "A": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a quotation about Elizabeth Catlett that supports the student's claim that this artist had a talent for unifying various traditions and styles in her work. The quotation explains that to create the work, Catlett combined Indigenous sculpture with the visual aesthetic of modern muralists from Mexico as well as that of German artist Kathe Kollwitz. In other words, Catlett was able to unify several artistic traditions and styles within a single sculpture.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because in discussing the technique and subject matter of Catlett's collage, the quotation makes no reference to particular traditions or styles.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because in describing the sculpture, the quotation doesn't mention any artistic traditions or styles that Catlett may have synthesized to create the work.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because in discussing Catlett's prints of notable African American women, the quotation doesn't characterize those prints as having fused different traditions or styles."
