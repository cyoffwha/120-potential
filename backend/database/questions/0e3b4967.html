The text describes how Alspaugh&rsquo;s scrapbook is both a record of her life and a historical record of nineteenth-century textiles and dressmaking. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The text says that it was common for American women to keep scrapbooks of fabric pieces in the nineteenth century, and it says that Alspaugh was one of these women. However, it never says that other women were inspired by Alspaugh. Choice B is incorrect. This is too general and too strong. The text says that Alspaugh&rsquo;s scrapbook is a historical record of nineteenth-century textiles and dressmaking, but it never says that historians rely on such scrapbooks in general to understand how fashions changed throughout that time period. This choice also fails to even mention Alspaugh, who is the real focus of the text. Choice C is incorrect. The text does say this, but it&rsquo;s a detail&mdash;not the main idea. The text is mainly about one woman&rsquo;s scrapbook (Alspaugh&rsquo;s), and this choice doesn&rsquo;t even mention her. </p>
