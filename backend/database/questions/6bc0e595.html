                	<p>Choice B is the best answer. The text tells us that &ldquo;people who got to touch the items were willing to pay much more money for them than people who weren&rsquo;t allowed to touch&rdquo; them. This suggests that being able to interact with a product in person may make it seem more valuable to a shopper. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn&rsquo;t discuss how much people spend each month, so there&rsquo;s not much basis for this claim. Furthermore, since being able to touch a product tends to make people &ldquo;willing to pay much more money&rdquo; for it, we might predict that an online shopper would be willing to spend less on the same purchases as an in-person shopper. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn&rsquo;t discuss what retailers &ldquo;should charge,&rdquo; so there&rsquo;s not much basis for this claim. Furthermore, the study in the text suggests that in-person stores may actually be able to charge more for a given product, since shoppers can touch it. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn&rsquo;t discuss products that are only available online, so there&rsquo;s not much basis for this claim. Furthermore, products only available online would still have the problem of shoppers not being able to touch them, and the study suggests that this lowers the prices shoppers are willing to pay. </p>
