    "to forge",

    "forged",

  ],
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of finite and nonfinite verb forms within a sentence. The nonfinite to-infinitive \"to forge\" is correctly used to form a nonfinite (infinitive) clause that explains why the chemists re-created and reprogrammed the DNA-cleaving bacteria.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. Without a comma separating the main clause (\"chemists...bacteria\") from the participle \"forging,\" this choice illogically suggests that the bacteria are forging a tool, which doesn't make sense.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. Without a coordinating conjunction such as \"and\" placed before it, the finite past tense verb \"forged\" can't be used in this way to describe the chemists' actions.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. If read as a finite verb, the present progressive verb \"forging\" isn't consistent with the past tense verbs used in this sentence to describe the actions of the chemists. If read as a nonfinite verb, the participle \"forging\" can't be used in this way because there is no following main clause for it to modify."
