  "correct_answer": "A",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of nonfinite verb forms in a sentence. The nonfinite to-infinitive verb \"to join\" is correctly used to form a subordinate clause that expresses why Ochoa left her position (to join the training program).",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because the finite verb \"is joining\" can't be used in this way to indicate Ochoa's action of joining the training program. A conjunction such as \"and\" would be needed to coordinate \"is joining\" with the previous finite verb, \"left.\"",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because the finite verb \"joined\" can't be used in this way to indicate Ochoa's action of joining the training program. A conjunction such as \"and\" would be needed to coordinate \"joined\" with the previous finite verb, \"left.\"",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because the finite verb \"joins\" can't be used in this way to indicate Ochoa's action of joining the training program. A conjunction such as \"and\" would be needed to coordinate \"joins\" with the previous finite verb, \"left.\""
