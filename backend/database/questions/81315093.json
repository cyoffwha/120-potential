An ultramarathon is a long-distance running race of more than 26.2 miles. The Kepler Challenge is a one-day, 37.3-mile ultramarathon in New Zealand. The Spreelauf is a six-day, 261-mile ultramarathon in Germany. The student wants to make a generalization about ultramarathons. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",

  "answer_options": [
    "Examples of ultramarathons include the 37.3-mile Kepler Challenge in New Zealand and the 261-mile Spreelauf in Germany.",
    "A marathon is 26.2 miles long, but the Spreelauf ultramarathon, at 261 miles, is far longer.",
    "Ultramarathons range widely in length, from a few dozen miles to a few hundred.",
    "While the Kepler Challenge is a one-day ultramarathon, the Spreelauf is a six-day ultramarathon."

    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. This is the only choice that makes a generalization about ultramarathons.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This choice gives specific examples of ultramarathons but doesn't say anything about them as a category.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice compares marathons in general to one specific ultramarathon but doesn't say anything about ultramarathons as a category.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This choice contrasts two specific ultramarathons but doesn't say anything about them as a category."
