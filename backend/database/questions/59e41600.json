  "passage": "Why are Rome's famous concrete structures, such as the Colosseum, still standing after 2,000-plus years, when modern concrete may not even last for fifty? Scientists ______ blank that the secret to Roman concrete's durability was its unique blend of ingredients, which included volcanic ash and seawater.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verb forms within a sentence. The main clause of a sentence requires a finite (tensed) verb, and this choice supplies the finite present tense verb \"explain\" to indicate what the scientists do.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite participle \"having explained\" doesn't supply the main clause with a finite verb.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite participle \"explaining\" doesn't supply the main clause with a finite verb.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite to-infinitive \"to explain\" doesn't supply the main clause with a finite verb."
