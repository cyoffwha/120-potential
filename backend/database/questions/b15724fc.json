  "answer_rationales": {
    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period after \"essays\" is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (\"American&hellip;essays\") and another (\"praising&hellip;Morrison\"). The participial phrase beginning with \"Praising\" modifies the subject of the second sentence, \"writer Robert Antoni.\"",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can't be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. Without a comma preceding it, the conjunction \"and\" can't be used in this way to join sentences.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences (\"American&hellip;essays\" and \"Praising&hellip;Morrison\") are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction."
