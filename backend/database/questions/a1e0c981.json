    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. \"Themes of childhood\" is one noun phrase, with \"themes of\" implicitly carrying over to the other items on the list (\"themes of childhood, [themes of] womanhood, and [themes of] Chinese American identity\").",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This choice inappropriately breaks up the introduction of a list. Also, \"In her book&hellip;themes of\" is not an independent clause, thanks to the dangling \"of\" at the end, so it can't precede a colon.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. This choice inappropriately breaks up the introduction of a list. Also, \"In her book&hellip;themes of\" is not an independent clause, thanks to the dangling \"of\" at the end, so it can't precede a single dash.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This choice inappropriately breaks up the introduction of a list. \"Themes of\" implicitly carries over to each item on the list (\"themes of childhood, [themes of] womanhood, and [themes of] Chinese American identity\"), so we don't want to use a comma to separate it."
