This quotation states that the country meant a great deal to Alexandra and then goes on to detail several ways in which her natural surroundings affect her emotionally: the insects sound like &ldquo;the sweetest music,&rdquo; she feels as though &ldquo;her heart were hiding&rdquo; in the grass &ldquo;with the quail and the plover,&rdquo; and near the ridges she feels &ldquo;the future stirring.&rdquo; </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the quotation doesn&rsquo;t suggest that Alexandra had a deep emotional connection to her natural surroundings but instead describes how she interacts with the people around her to learn more about crops, poultry, and experiments with clover hay. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation doesn&rsquo;t suggest that Alexandra has a deep emotional connection to her natural surroundings but instead describes her nighttime departure in a wagon.
