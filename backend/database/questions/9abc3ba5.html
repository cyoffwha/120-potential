In the 1970s, American painter Jack Whitten built a 12-foot (3.7-meter) tool he named the &ldquo;developer&rdquo; to apply paint to an entire canvas in one motion, resulting in his series of &ldquo;slab&rdquo; paintings from that decade. &nbsp;Whitten described this process as making an entire painting in &ldquo;one gesture,&rdquo; signaling a clear departure from the prevalence of gestures in his work from the 1960s. Some art historians claim this shift represents &ldquo;removing gesture&rdquo; from the process. Therefore, regardless of whether using the developer constitutes a gesture, both Whitten and these art historians likely agree that <span aria-hidden="true">______</span><span class="sr-only">blank</span></p></div>
