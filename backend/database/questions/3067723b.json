  "passage": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: The Seikan Tunnel is a rail tunnel in Japan. It connects the island of Honshu to the island of Hokkaido. It is roughly 33 miles long. The Channel Tunnel is a rail tunnel in Europe. It connects Folkestone, England, to Coquelles, France. It is about 31 miles long. The student wants to compare the lengths of the two rail tunnels. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",
  "question_text": "The student wants to compare the lengths of the two rail tunnels. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",
  "answer_options": [
    "Some of the world&rsquo;s rail tunnels,&nbsp;including one tunnel that extends from Folkestone, England, to Coquelles, France, are longer than 30 miles.",
    "The Seikan Tunnel is roughly 33 miles long, while the slightly shorter Channel Tunnel is about 31 miles long.",
    "The Seikan Tunnel, which is roughly 33 miles long, connects the Japanese islands of Honshu and Hokkaido.",
    "Both the Seikan Tunnel, which is located in Japan, and the Channel Tunnel, which is located in Europe, are examples of rail tunnels."
  ],
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. The sentence compares the lengths of the two rail tunnels, noting that the Channel Tunnel (about 31 miles long) is slightly shorter than the Seikan Tunnel (roughly 33 miles long).",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. The sentence makes a generalization about the length of some rail tunnels; it doesn't compare the lengths of the two rail tunnels.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. The sentence describes a single rail tunnel; it doesn't compare the lengths of the two rail tunnels.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence mentions the two rail tunnels, it doesn't compare their lengths."
