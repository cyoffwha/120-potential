    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of items in a series. The comma after \"themselves\" is used conventionally to separate the first item (\"they can clone themselves\") and the second item (\"enter a dormant state in times of drought\") in the series of things mosses can do.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because a semicolon can't be used in this way to separate items in a simple series such as this.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with \"And enter.\"",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because it fails to use appropriate punctuation to separate the first and second items in the series."
