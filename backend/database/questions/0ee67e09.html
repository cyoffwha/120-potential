                	<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of the fossilized bones of the hominin known as Little Foot.

The text indicates that the relationship between the fossilized clavicle and shoulder bones of Little Foot and the clavicle and shoulder bones of &ldquo;frequent climbers,&rdquo; such as chimpanzees and gorillas, suggests that Little Foot had adapted to moving around in trees.

If anything, learning that Little Foot&rsquo;s clavicle and shoulder bones were surpassed by those of chimpanzees and gorillas would suggest that Little Foot was poorly adapted to climbing.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because if Little Foot&rsquo;s fossilized clavicle and shoulder bones were &ldquo;independent of,&rdquo; or not influenced by or affiliated with, the bones of modern apes that climb often, it wouldn&rsquo;t suggest, as the text says, that Little Foot was adapted to moving around in trees.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that Little Foot&rsquo;s fossilized bones date to 3.6 million years ago, so they couldn&rsquo;t have been &ldquo;obtained from,&rdquo; or acquired from, the bones of modern apes.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
