    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. The word \"earning\" is being used to introduce an additional modifying phrase, which describes how Fairuz's repertoire lent her cross-generational appeal. When a verb ends in -ing and doesn't have a helper verb like \"is\" before it, it can be used to modify a noun or verb. This is appropriate here.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. The underlined verb is being used to introduce additional descriptive information, which is set off from the rest of the sentence by a comma. Because there is no subject here, a finite form of the verb (like \"earned\") creates an error. We need another form of the verb that doesn't require a subject and can introduce descriptive information.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. The underlined verb is being used to introduce additional descriptive information, which is set off from the rest of the sentence by a comma. Because there is no subject here, a finite form of the verb (like \"had earned\") creates an error. We need another form of the verb that doesn't require a subject and can introduce descriptive information.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. The underlined verb is being used to introduce additional descriptive information, which is set off from the rest of the sentence by a comma. Because there is no subject here, a finite form of the verb (like \"earn\") creates an error. We need another form of the verb that doesn't require a subject and can introduce descriptive information."
