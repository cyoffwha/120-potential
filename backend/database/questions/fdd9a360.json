  "passage": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: The popular wood-wide web theory posits that trees can communicate and exchange resources with one another via common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) of fungi. Ecologist Dr. Suzanne Simard first suggested this theory in 1997. She described trees as \"super-cooperators.\" In the 2022 study \"The Decay of the Wood-Wide Web?,\" mycologist Dr. Justine Karst and colleagues evaluated dozens of CMN studies. They write that CMNs \"have captured the interest of broad audiences. We are concerned, however, that recent claims about CMNs in forests are disconnected from evidence.\" The student wants to use a quotation to emphasize a potential problem with the wood-wide web theory. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",

  "answer_options": [
    "Describing trees as &ldquo;super-cooperators,&rdquo; Simard first suggested that trees can exchange resources with one another in 1997.",
    "In &ldquo;The Decay of the Wood-Wide Web?,&rdquo; Karst and colleagues note that common mycorrhizal networks &ldquo;have captured the interest of broad audiences.&rdquo;",
    "After evaluating dozens of CMN studies, Karst and colleagues expressed concern that recent claims about common mycorrhizal networks are &ldquo;disconnected from evidence.&rdquo;",
    "Despite the concerns expressed in the 2022 study &ldquo;The Decay of the Wood-Wide Web?,&rdquo; the wood-wide web theory remains popular."

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. This choice uses a quotation to convey the authors' criticism and challenge to the wood-wide web theory due to an absence of evidence.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn't emphasize a potential problem with the wood-wide web theory. It uses a quotation to introduce the theory and its originator. It doesn't mention any criticism or challenge to the theory.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a quotation, but it doesn't emphasize a potential problem with the wood-wide web theory. It uses a quotation to describe the appeal and interest of the theory, but it doesn't indicate why the authors are concerned or what evidence they have.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn't use a quotation at all. It paraphrases the main idea of the 2022 study, but it doesn't include any specific words or phrases from the notes. It also doesn't emphasize a potential problem with the theory, but rather its popularity."
