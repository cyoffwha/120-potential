                	<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim in the text that John is hard-working and dedicated to his job. In the quotation, John is portrayed as spending &ldquo;early morn to the fall of the afternoon&rdquo; working hard as a water carrier. John is also described as &ldquo;so accustomed to bending&rdquo; while doing his work &ldquo;that he never thought of straightening&rdquo; his body, instead remaining deeply focused on his work. These details portray John as a dedicated worker. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because this quotation portrays John as happy about heading home after being paid. It doesn&rsquo;t showcase John being hard at work. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn&rsquo;t pertain to John&rsquo;s commitment to his work; it describes difficulties the traffic in the city causes John in the performance of his work. Choice D is incorrect because this quotation doesn&rsquo;t pertain to John&rsquo;s commitment to his work; it discusses what John does with his worn-out water jugs. </p>
