    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. The subject of the sentence is \"The African Games Co-production Market.\" That's one market, so it's a singular noun, which means it needs a singular verb. \"Promotes\" is the only singular verb among the choices.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a subject-verb agreement error. The subject \"The African Games Co-production Market\" is singular, but the verb \"promote\" is plural.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a subject-verb agreement error. The subject \"The African Games Co-production Market\" is singular, but the verb \"are promoting\" is plural.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a subject-verb agreement error. The subject \"The African Games Co-production Market\" is singular, but the verb \"have promoted\" is plural."
