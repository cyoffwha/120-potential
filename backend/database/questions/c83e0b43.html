                	<p>Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation from <em>O Pioneers!</em> to illustrate the claim that Alexandra Bergson takes comfort in understanding the world around her. In the quotation, Alexandra is described as enjoying looking at the stars and feeling a &ldquo;sense of personal security&rdquo; when she contemplates nature&rsquo;s order and its governing laws. This suggests that Alexandra takes comfort in understanding the world around her.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the quotation expresses how Alexandra Bergson attempts to meet difficult situations with determination, not how she takes comfort in understanding the world around her. Choice B is incorrect because the quotation expresses &ldquo;how much the country meant to&rdquo; Alexandra Bergson, not how she takes comfort in understanding the world around her. In detailing some of the wildlife surrounding Alexandra, the quotation conveys that nature is important to her but not necessarily that it gives her comfort.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the quotation describes Alexandra driving her wagon down a highway at night; it doesn&rsquo;t describe how she takes comfort in understanding the world around her or address how she&rsquo;s feeling as she drives off.&nbsp;</p>
