A nearly frictionless (and, as its name suggests, extremely slippery) state, ______ blank",
  "question_text": "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?",
  "answer_options": [
    "when their COF drops below 0.01, two surfaces reach superlubricity.",
    "two surfaces, when their COF drops below 0.01, reach superlubricity.",
    "reaching superlubricity occurs when two surfaces&rsquo; COF drops below 0.01.",
    "superlubricity is reached when two surfaces&rsquo; COF drops below 0.01."

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. The subject of the modifier \"a nearly frictionless state\" is \"superlubricity.\" Subject-modifier placement requires a modifier and its subject to be next to one another, so \"superlubricity\" must be the first word in the missing clause.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a subject-modifier placement error. The subject of the modifier \"a nearly frictionless state\" is \"superlubricity.\" Subject-modifier placement requires a modifier and its subject to be next to one another, so \"superlubricity\" must be the first word in the missing clause.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a subject-modifier placement error. The subject of the modifier \"a nearly frictionless state\" is \"superlubricity.\" Subject-modifier placement requires a modifier and its subject to be next to one another, so \"superlubricity\" must be the first word in the missing clause.",
