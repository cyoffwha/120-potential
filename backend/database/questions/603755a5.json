    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. \"That is&hellip;field\" is an essential supplement, so we should not use a comma (or any kind of punctuation) to separate it from \"scuba diving club.\" .",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. \"That is&hellip;field\" is an essential supplement, so we should not use a dash (or any kind of punctuation) to separate it from \"scuba diving club.\" .",
