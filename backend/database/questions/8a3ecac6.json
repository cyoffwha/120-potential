  "passage": "North American gray wolves usually have mixed gray and white fur, but some members of the species have a version of a gene, or gene variant, that gives them a mostly black coat instead. Sarah Cubaynes and her team studied twelve populations of North American gray wolves. They found that the black-furred wolves are more common in areas where outbreaks of distemper virus happen regularly. The team also discovered that the black-furred wolves are more likely to be immune to distemper than the gray-furred wolves are. Taken together, these findings suggest that ______ blank",
  "question_text": "Which choice most logically completes the text?",
  "answer_options": [
    "North American gray wolves experience more outbreaks of distemper virus than other wolf species do.",
    "the gene variant that results in black fur may be linked to immunity to the distemper virus.",
    "the average life span of gray wolves is likely to increase over time because of a particular gene variant.",
    "gray-furred wolves will soon replace black-furred wolves across North America."
  ],
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. The text tells us that the black-furred wolves are more common in areas with regular outbreaks of distemper virus and are more likely to be immune to distemper than the gray-furred wolves. This suggests that the gene variant that results in black fur may be linked to immunity to the distemper virus.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. The text never compares North American gray wolves to other wolf speciesâ€”in fact, it never discusses other wolf species at all, so there's no basis for this inference.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. The life span of gray wolves is never mentioned in this text, so we have no basis for this inference.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This is too extreme. The text says that \"black-furred wolves are more likely to be immune to distemper than the gray-furred wolves,\" but that alone doesn't mean that black-furred wolves will replace gray-furred wolves across North America."
