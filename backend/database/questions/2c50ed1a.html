                        <div><p><strong>Text 1</strong></p>
<p>Literary scholars have struggled with the vastness of Nigerian writer Wole Soyinka&rsquo;s collective works of drama (spanning over 20 plays in total). It is best, however, to understand Soyinka&rsquo;s body of work as a dramatist chronologically. Soyinka&rsquo;s progression as a playwright can be considered to fall into three periods, with each one representing a particular thematic and stylistic cohesion: the 1960s, the two decades between 1970 and 1990, and lastly, from roughly 1990 onwards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Text 2</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is tempting to impose a linear sense of order on the expanse of Wole Soyinka&rsquo;s body of work as a dramatist. However, critics who have considered Soyinka&rsquo;s plays to fit neatly into three phases overlook potential commonalities in Soyinka&rsquo;s work that span across these phases. Additionally, this view may discount significant differences in the styles and content of plays written around the same time.&nbsp;</p></div>

The author of Text 1 states that Soyinka&rsquo;s progression as a playwright can be considered to fall into three periods, implying that this is a helpful way to understand his works.

This choice overstates the central claim of Text 2. The author of Text 2 argues against the chronological progression supported in Text 1, but does not go so far as to say that Soyinka&rsquo;s style remained consistent. In fact, Text 2 points out &ldquo;significant differences in styles and content&rdquo; among Soyinka&rsquo;s plays. Choice C is incorrect. Neither of the texts mention Soyinka&rsquo;s poetry, nor do they rank his dramatic writing relative to his other work. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text discusses the political aspects of Soyinka&rsquo;s plays, nor do they make any claims about whether they have changed over time. </p>
