  "answer_rationales": {
    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. It's the only choice that offers a form of the verb \"acknowledge\" that can go with the subject \"International Astronomical Union\" to make a complete sentence. This might seem like an odd use of \"would,\" but when speaking from a point of view in the past, we can actually use \"would\" to express something that happened later. That's the case here: 200 years after Wang Zhenyi's death, the IAU would finally acknowledge her contributions.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a sentence fragment. There's no main verb elsewhere in the sentence, so we need a form of the verb \"acknowledge\" that can go with the subject \"the International Astronomical Union\" and serve as that main verb. \"To acknowledge\" can't do that.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a sentence fragment. There's no main verb elsewhere in the sentence, so we need a form of the verb \"acknowledge\" that can go with the subject \"the International Astronomical Union\" and serve as that main verb. \"Having acknowledged\" can't do that.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a sentence fragment. There's no main verb elsewhere in the sentence, so we need a form of the verb \"acknowledge\" that can go with the subject \"the International Astronomical Union\" and serve as that main verb. The \"-ing\" form can't do that."
