  "answer_rationales": {
    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice correctly uses a comma and the coordinating conjunction \"and\" to join the first main clause (\"He&hellip;1680\") and the second main clause (\"as&hellip;time\").",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because when coordinating two longer main clauses such as these, it's conventional to use a comma before the coordinating conjunction.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can't be used in this way to join two main clauses."
