    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verb forms within a sentence. Relative clauses, such as the one beginning with \"how,\" require a finite (tensed) verb, a verb that can function as the main verb of a clause. This choice correctly supplies the clause with the finite past tense verb \"served.\"",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite participle \"serving\" doesn't supply the clause with a finite verb.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite participle \"having served\" doesn't supply the clause with a finite verb.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite to-infinitive \"to serve\" doesn't supply the clause with a finite verb."
