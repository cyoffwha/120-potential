    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (\"In&hellip; Panchali \") and another (\"A quiet&hellip;time\"). The phrase beginning with \"a quiet\" modifies the subject of the next sentence, \"Ray's film.\"",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can't be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can't be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences."
