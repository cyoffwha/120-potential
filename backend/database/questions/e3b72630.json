    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of finite and nonfinite verb forms within a sentence. The nonfinite to-infinitive \"to tell\" is correctly used to form a nonfinite (infinitive) clause that explains the reason Engle uses poetry in her novel.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because the finite present tense verb \"tells\" can't be used in this way to explain the reason that Engle uses poetry in her novel.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because the finite past tense verb \"told\" can't be used in this way to explain the reason that Engle uses poetry in her novel.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because the finite present progressive tense verb \"is telling\" can't be used in this way to explain the reason that Engle uses poetry in her novel."
