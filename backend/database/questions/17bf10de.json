  "passage": "Text 1 Despite its beautiful prose, The Guns of August , Barbara Tuchman's 1962 analysis of the start of World War I, has certain weaknesses as a work of history. It fails to address events in Eastern Europe just before the outbreak of hostilities, thereby giving the impression that Germany was the war's principal instigator. Had Tuchman consulted secondary works available to her by scholars such as Luigi Albertini, she would not have neglected the influence of events in Eastern Europe on Germany's actions. Text 2 Barbara Tuchman's The Guns of August is an engrossing if dated introduction to World War I. Tuchman's analysis of primary documents is laudable, but her main thesis that European powers committed themselves to a catastrophic outcome by refusing to deviate from military plans developed prior to the conflict is implausibly reductive.",
  "question_text": "Which choice best describes a difference in how the authors of Text 1 and Text 2 view Barbara Tuchman&rsquo;s  The Guns of August ?",
  "answer_options": [
    "The author of Text 1 argues that Tuchman should have relied more on the work of other historians, while the author of Text 2 implies that Tuchman&rsquo;s most interesting claims result from her original research.",
    "The author of Text 1 believes that the scope of Tuchman&rsquo;s research led her to an incorrect interpretation, while the author of Text 2 believes that Tuchman&rsquo;s central argument is overly simplistic.",
    "The author of Text 1 asserts that the writing style of  The Guns of August  makes it worthwhile to read despite any perceived deficiency in Tuchman&rsquo;s research, while the author of Text 2 focuses exclusively on the weakness of Tuchman&rsquo;s interpretation of events.",
    "The author of Text 1 claims that Tuchman would agree that World War I was largely due to events in Eastern Europe, while the author of Text 2 maintains that Tuchman would say that Eastern European leaders were not committed to military plans in the same way that other leaders were."
  ],
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. Both texts are critical of The Guns of August , but for different reasons: the author of Text 1 argues that Tuchman missed an important factor leading up to the war because she didn't consult secondary sources, and the author of Text 2 argues that Tuchman's main thesis is \"reductive,\" which is a close synonym for \"overly simplistic.\"",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This doesn't accurately describe the difference. This choice's summary of Text 1 is accurate, but Text 2 never says that Tuchman's most interesting claims result from her original research.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. This doesn't accurately describe the difference. Text 1 never says that The Guns of August is worthwhile to read despite its research weaknesses. Text 2 does call out a weakness of Tuchman's interpretation of events, but it also praises her analysis of primary sources.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This doesn't accurately describe the difference. Text 1 actually says that Tuchman \"fails to address\" the influence of events in Eastern Europe, while Text 2 says that Tuchman's thesis was that European powers (not Eastern European leaders) were committed to military plans."
