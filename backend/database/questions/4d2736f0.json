  "passage": "In her poetry collection Thomas and Beulah , Rita Dove interweaves the titular characters' personal stories with broader historical narratives. She places Thomas's journey from the American South to the Midwest in the early 1900s within the larger context of the Great Migration. ______ blank Dove sets events from Beulah's personal life against the backdrop of the US Civil Rights Movement.",

  "answer_rationales": {
    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. \"Similarly\" logically signals that the information in the sentence—that Dove situates Beulah's life in the context of the US Civil Rights Movement—is similar to the previous information about Thomas and the Great Migration. Both sentences support the first sentence's claim that Dove portrays her characters in the context of broader historical narratives.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because \"specifically\" illogically signals that the information about Beulah in this sentence provides specific details elaborating on the previous information about Thomas. Instead, it's similar to the previous information about Thomas.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because \"thus\" illogically signals that the information about Beulah in this sentence is a result or consequence of the previous information about Thomas. Instead, it's similar to the previous information about Thomas.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because \"regardless\" illogically signals that the information about Beulah in this sentence is true despite the previous information about Thomas. Instead, it's similar to the previous information about Thomas."
