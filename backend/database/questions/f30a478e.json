  "passage": "A study published by Rice University geoscientist Ming Tang in 2019 offers a new explanation for the origin of Earth's ______ blank structures called arcs, towering ridges that form when a dense oceanic plate subducts under a less dense continental plate, melts in the mantle below, and then rises and bursts through the continental crust above.",

  "answer_options": [
    "continents geological",

  "answer_rationales": {
    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between a main clause and a supplementary phrase. In this choice, a colon is correctly used to mark the boundary between the main clause (\"A study&hellip;continents\") and the supplementary phrase (\"geological&hellip;above\") and to introduce the following explanation of the origin of Earth's continents.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the main clause (\"A study&hellip;continents\") and the supplementary phrase (\"geological&hellip;above\") with appropriate punctuation.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because a semicolon can't be used in this way to join the main clause (\"A study&hellip;continents\") and the supplementary phrase (\"geological&hellip;above\"). A semicolon is conventionally used to join two main clauses, whereas a colon is conventionally used to introduce an element that explains or amplifies the information in the preceding clause, making it the better choice in this context.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with \"geological.\""
