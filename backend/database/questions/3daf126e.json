    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is finite and nonfinite verb forms within a sentence. Relative clauses, such as the one beginning with \"that,\" require a finite verb, a verb that can function as the main verb of a clause. This choice correctly supplies the clause with the finite future tense verb \"will be.\"",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because the nonfinite participle \"being\" doesn't supply the clause with a finite verb.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because the nonfinite to-infinitive \"to be\" doesn't supply the clause with a finite verb.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because the nonfinite to-infinitive \"to have been\" doesn't supply the clause with a finite verb."
