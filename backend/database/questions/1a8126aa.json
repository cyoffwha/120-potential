  "passage": "In 2019, researcher Patricia Jurado Gonzalez and food historian Nawal Nasrallah prepared a stew from a 4,000-year-old recipe found on a Mesopotamian clay tablet. When they tasted the dish, known as pa&scaron;rūtum (\"unwinding\"), they found that it had a mild taste and inspired a sense of calm. ______ blank the researchers, knowing that dishes were sometimes named after their intended effects, theorized that the dish's name, \"unwinding,\" referred to its function: to help ancient diners relax.",

  "answer_rationales": {
    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. \"Therefore\" logically signals that the action described in this sentence—the researchers theorizing that the dish was named for its effect on diners—is a result or consequence of the previous observation that the dish had a calming effect.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because \"alternately\" illogically signals that the action described in this sentence offers an alternative or contrast to the previous observation that the dish had a calming effect. Instead, the action is a result or consequence of that observation.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because \"nevertheless\" illogically signals that the action described in this sentence occurs despite the previous observation that the dish had a calming effect. Instead, the action is a result or consequence of that observation.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because \"likewise\" illogically signals that this sentence merely adds a second, similar detail to the previous observation that the dish had a calming effect. Instead, this sentence describes an action that is a result or consequence of that observation."
