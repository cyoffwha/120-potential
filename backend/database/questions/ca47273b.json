  "correct_answer": "C",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. \"Spans\" means \"extends over a distance of\" or \"encompasses.\" Since we're talking about the world's largest plant, it makes sense to say that it \"spans\" about 200 square kilometers.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. \"Acknowledges\" means \"recognizes\" or \"admits the truth of.\" Either way, it doesn't make sense here: a plant can't \"acknowledge\" a distance.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. \"Produces\" can mean \"makes,\" \"causes,\" or \"presents.\" But none of those definitions make sense here: a plant can't make, cause, or present a distance.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This doesn't fit the logic of the text. \"Advances\" means \"moves forward\" or \"progresses.\" But the plant isn't necessarily moving forward. Rather, the text suggests that it already covers a distance of 200 square kilometers."
