    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. This choice uses a comma and a coordinating conjunction (\"and\") to join two independent clauses (\"The Tantaquidgeon&hellip;Tribe\" and \"Today&hellip;country\").",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice results in a grammar error known as a run-on sentence. The clauses before and after \"Tribe\" are both independent, so they need to be separated with some sort of punctuation.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a grammar error known as a run-on sentence. The clauses before and after \"and\" are both independent, so they can't be linked with just a conjunction. A comma would also be required.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a grammar error called a comma splice. The clauses before and after \"Tribe\" are both independent, so they can't be linked with just a comma. A coordinating conjunction like \"and\" or \"but\" would also be required."
