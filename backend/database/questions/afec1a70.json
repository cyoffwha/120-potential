  "passage": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: As engineered structures, many bird nests are uniquely flexible yet cohesive. A research team led by Yashraj Bhosale wanted to better understand the mechanics behind these structural properties. Bhosale's team used laboratory models that simulated the arrangement of flexible sticks into nest-like structures. The researchers analyzed the points where sticks touched one another. When pressure was applied to the model nests, the number of contact points between the sticks increased, making the structures stiffer. The student wants to present the primary aim of the research study. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. It describes the reason Bhosale's team wanted to study the structures of bird nestsâ€”that is to say, the study's primary aim.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn't present the primary aim of the research study. It describes how the study worked, but not why it was done.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn't present the primary aim of the research study. It describes a result of the experiment, but not why it was carried out.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn't present the primary aim of the research study."
