<p>What factors influence the abundance of species in a given ecological community? Some theorists have argued that historical diversity is a major driver of how diverse an ecological community eventually becomes: differences in community diversity across otherwise similar habitats, in this view, are strongly affected by the number of species living in those habitats at earlier times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Text 2</p>
<p>In 2010, a group of researchers including biologist Carla C&aacute;ceres created artificial pools in a New York forest. They stocked some pools with a diverse mix of zooplankton species and others with a single zooplankton species and allowed the pool communities to develop naturally thereafter. Over the course of four years, C&aacute;ceres and colleagues periodically measured the species diversity of the pools, finding&mdash;contrary to their expectations&mdash;that by the end of the study there was little to no difference in the pools&rsquo; species diversity.&nbsp;</p></div>
