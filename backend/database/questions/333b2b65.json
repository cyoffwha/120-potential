    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. A comma is the appropriate way to link the dependent clause \"While...not\" and the independent clause that follows.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. \"While...not\" is a dependent clause, which must be separated from the independent clause that follows with some sort of punctuation.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a sentence fragment. \"While one requires oxygen and one does not\" isn't an independent clause, so it can't stand alone as a complete sentence.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. \"While one requires oxygen and one does not\" isn't an independent clause, so it can't be linked to the clause that follows with a semicolon."
