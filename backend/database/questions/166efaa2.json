    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is pronoun&ndash;antecedent agreement. The plural pronoun \"they\" agrees in number with the plural antecedent \"customers.\"",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because the singular pronoun \"one\" doesn't agree in number with the plural antecedent \"customers.\"",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because the second person pronoun \"you\" isn't conventional as a substitute for \"customers.\" It suggests that the audience (\"you\") is the customer.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because the singular pronoun \"it\" doesn't agree in number with the plural antecedent \"customers.\""
