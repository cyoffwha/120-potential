  "passage": "For her 2021 art installation Anthem , Wu Tsang joined forces with singer and composer Beverly Glenn-Copeland to produce a piece that critics found truly ______ blank : they praised Tsang for creatively transforming a museum rotunda into a dynamic exhibit by projecting filmed images of Glenn-Copeland onto a massive 84-foot curtain and filling the space with the sounds of his and other voices singing.",
  "question_text": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
  "answer_options": [
    "restrained",
    "inventive",
    "inexplicable",
    "mystifying"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "B": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the art installation Anthem . In this context, \"inventive\" means characterized by invention and creativity. The text explains that critics' responses to the installation involved praise for Tsang's creative transformation of a space into a dynamic exhibit with huge images and lots of sound. This context conveys that the critics found the piece particularly creative.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that critics praised the installation for being dynamic and including huge images and lots of sound, and it wouldn't make sense to describe such an exhibit as \"restrained,\" or limited and not extravagant or showy.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to say that critics found the installation \"inexplicable,\" or incapable of being explained or interpreted, since the critics were able to explain their praise for the installation's transformation of a space with huge images and lots of sound.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because the text focuses on the idea that critics praised Tsang for creatively transforming a space into a dynamic exhibit, not that they found the installation \"mystifying,\" or bewildering and hard to understand. Nothing in the text suggests that the critics couldn't understand the piece."
