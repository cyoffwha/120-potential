    "the focus of many critics has been on Kurosawa&rsquo;s use of Western literary sources; they"

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-modifier placement. This choice makes the noun phrase \"many critics\" the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phrase \"in assessing&hellip;Kurosawa.\" In doing so, this choice clearly establishes that it is the critics—and not another noun in the sentence—who assess Kurosawa's films.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the noun phrase \"Kurosawa's&hellip;sources\" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that his use of Western literary sources is what assesses Kurosawa's films.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the function word \"there\" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that \"there\" is what assesses Kurosawa's films.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the noun phrase \"the focus&hellip;critics\" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that the critics' focus is what assesses Kurosawa's films."
