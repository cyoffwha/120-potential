                	<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation to illustrate the claim that Lady Gertrude Chiltern is perceived as &ldquo;both extremely virtuous and unforgiving.&rdquo; In the quotation, a man describes Lady Chiltern as someone who &ldquo;does not know what weakness or temptation is.&rdquo; In other words, the man regards her as someone who is strong and adheres to a strict definition of moral perfection. However, he ironically suggests that this definition excludes mercy and forgiveness&mdash;qualities that are also thought of as virtues; according to him, Lady Chiltern is &ldquo;pitiless in her perfection&mdash;cold and stern and without mercy.&rdquo; This description supports the idea that Lady Chiltern is perceived by others as virtuous as well as unforgiving. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The quotation supports the claim that Lady Chiltern is perceived as virtuous, in that it describes her as &ldquo;a woman of the very highest principles.&rdquo; However, it doesn&rsquo;t characterize her as unforgiving or being perceived as such. Choice B is incorrect. The quotation suggests that Lady Chiltern is concerned with morality, but it suggests that her interest in discussing it is fundamentally hypocritical and functions as a means by which to judge others. However, the quotation doesn&rsquo;t address the question of whether Lady Chiltern is unmerciful to those who seek forgiveness for harm they have caused. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t address either Lady Chiltern&rsquo;s perceived virtuousness or her perceived lack of forgiveness; instead, it expresses the belief that she is sensible. </p>
