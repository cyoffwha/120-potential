    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of possessive nouns. The singular possessive noun \"Moon's\" correctly indicates that there is only one Moon, and it has a gravitational pull.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because the context requires the singular possessive noun \"Moon's,\" not the plural noun \"Moons.\"",
