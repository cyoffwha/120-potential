    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of non-finite (untensed) verb forms in a sentence. The modal \"would,\" which indicates the future from a perspective in the past, should be accompanied by a non-finite plain form verb. In this choice, the non-finite plain form verb \"create\" is used correctly in conjunction with the non-finite plain form verb \"increase\" to describe what the lock would do.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because the finite present tense verb \"creates\" can't be used in this way with the modal \"would\" to describe what the lock would do.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because the present participle \"creating\" can't be used in this way with the modal \"would\" to describe what the lock would do.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because the finite past tense verb \"created\" can't be used in this way with the modal \"would\" to describe what the lock would do."
