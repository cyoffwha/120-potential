Orchidaceae species diversity has not been well studied in temperate forests, such as those in Oaxaca, Mexico. Arelee Estefan&iacute;a Mu&ntilde;oz-Hern&aacute;ndez led a study to determine how many different Orchidaceae species are present in the forests of Oaxaca. Mu&ntilde;oz-Hern&aacute;ndez and her team collected orchids each month for a year at a site in Oaxaca. Seventy-four Orchidaceae species were present at the site. The student wants to present the study and its findings. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",
