<p>Ecologists have long wondered how thousands of microscopic phytoplankton species can live together near ocean surfaces competing for the same resources. According to <span role="region" aria-label="Referenced Content"><u>conventional wisdom</u></span>, one species should emerge after outcompeting the rest. So why do so many species remain?

<p>Ecologist Michael Behrenfeld and colleagues have connected phytoplankton&rsquo;s diversity to their microscopic size. Because these organisms are so tiny, they are spaced relatively far apart from each other in ocean water and, moreover, experience that water as a relatively dense substance. This in turn makes it hard for them to move around and interact with one another. Therefore, says Behrenfeld&rsquo;s team, direct competition among phytoplankton probably happens much less than previously thought.</p></div>

                	<p>Choice A is the best answer because based on Text 2, it represents how Behrenfeld and colleagues would most likely respond to the &ldquo;conventional wisdom&rdquo; discussed in Text 1. The conventional wisdom cited holds the opinion that when there is species diversity within a phytoplankton population, &ldquo;one species should emerge after outcompeting the rest&rdquo;&mdash;that is, after being so successful in competing for resources that the other species vanish from the population. However, Text 2 explains that according to Behrenfeld and colleagues, phytoplankton are so small and spaced so far apart in the water that there is &ldquo;much less&rdquo; direct competition for resources within phytoplankton populations than scientists had previously thought.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 never discusses whether routine replenishment of ocean nutrients affects competition between phytoplankton species. Choice C is incorrect because the interspecies competition discussed in both texts is specifically between phytoplankton species, and neither text considers whether phytoplankton compete for resources with larger nonphytoplankton species.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because according to Text 2, Behrenfeld and colleagues argue that water density decreases, not increases, competition between phytoplankton species. </p>
