    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. It appropriately uses a period to mark the end of one independent clause (\"In 2000&hellip;settings\") and the start of another (\"She founded&hellip;professionals\").",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence error. Both the clause before the blank (\"In 2000&hellip;settings\") and the clause after the blank (\"she&hellip;professionals\") are independent clauses, so they need to be separated by punctuation.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice results in a comma splice error. It incorrectly joins two independent clauses with just a comma. Linking two independent clauses with a comma also requires the use of a coordinating conjunction (like for , and , nor , but , or , yet , or so ).",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence, an error caused when two independent clauses are joined without punctuation or appropriate conjunctions. Since both the clause before the blank (\"In 2000&hellip;settings\") and the clause after the blank (\"she&hellip;professionals\") are independent, a comma would be required in addition to the coordinating conjunction \"and.\""
