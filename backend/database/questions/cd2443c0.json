  ],
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-modifier placement. This choice makes the noun phrase \"Anna Behrensmeyer\" the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phrase \"a pioneer&hellip;fossils.\" In doing so, this choice clearly establishes that Anna Behrensmeyer—and not another noun in the sentence—is a pioneer in the field of taphonomy.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the noun phrase \"fossils of thin-shelled organisms\" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that the \"fossils\" are a pioneer in the field of taphonomy.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the pronoun \"it\" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that \"it\" is a pioneer in the field of taphonomy.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the noun phrase \"a 2005 analysis\" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that \"a 2005 analysis\" is a pioneer in the field of taphonomy."
