It improved on the existing design of train car couplers. It made the job of connecting train cars safer. In 1938, African American inventor Frederick Jones invented a mobile refrigeration system. It improved on the existing design of food transport trucks. It enabled trucks to carry perishable foods farther. The student wants to emphasize a similarity between Beard's invention and Jones's invention. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",
