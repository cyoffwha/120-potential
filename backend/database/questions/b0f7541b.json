  "passage": "The following text is adapted from Herman Melville's 1857 novel The Confidence-Man . Humphry Davy was a prominent British chemist and inventor. Years ago, a grave American savant, being in London, observed at an evening party there, a certain coxcombical fellow, as he thought, an absurd ribbon in his lapel, and full of smart [banter], whisking about to the admiration of as many as were disposed to admire. Great was the savant's disdain; but, chancing ere long to find himself in a corner with the jackanapes, got into conversation with him, when he was somewhat ill-prepared for the good sense of the jackanapes, but was altogether thrown aback, upon subsequently being [informed that he was] no less a personage than Sir Humphry Davy. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
  "question_text": "Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
  "answer_options": [
    "It portrays the thoughts of a character who is embarrassed about his own behavior.",
    "It presents an account of a misunderstanding.",
    "It offers a short history of how a person came to be famous.",
    "It explains why one character dislikes another."
  ],
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. The text tells a story of a first impression that turned out to be wrong: a serious American savant was dismissive of a goofy-looking, wisecracking guest at a British party, and then was shocked to learn that the guest was actually a prominent British chemist and inventor.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This is too strong and too narrow. Only at the very end is the savant \"thrown aback\" by the fact that the man was Sir Humphry Davyâ€”he's not \"embarrassed about his own behavior.\"",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. This isn't the main purpose. The text never provides the history of how Sir Humphry Davy came to be famous. Nor does it provide any history for the American savant.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This is too narrow. It doesn't include the second half of the text, where the savant gets into a conversation with the man and then finds out that the man is Sir Humphry Davy."
