  "passage": "The author's claim about the relationship between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens is ______ blank , as it fails to account for several recent archaeological discoveries. To be convincing, his argument would need to address recent finds of additional hominid fossils, such as the latest Denisovan specimens and Homo longi .",

  "answer_rationales": {
    "B": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the author's claim about the relationship between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens . As used in this context, \"tenuous\" means lacking substance. The end of the first sentence states that the author's claim didn't consider certain key pieces of evidence—\"recent archaeological discoveries\"—and is therefore weak.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context to refer to the author's claim as \"disorienting,\" or confusing. The text suggests that the author's claim is insubstantial, not that it's difficult to grasp.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because referring to the claim as \"nuanced,\" or subtle, wouldn't make sense in context. According to the text, the claim is incomplete because it didn't consider certain key information about recent archaeological finds; it doesn't suggest that what's in the claim lacks precision.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because saying that the claim is \"unoriginal,\" or imitative, wouldn't make sense in context. The text faults the claim because it doesn't consider certain key information about recent archaeological finds; it doesn't suggest that the author's claim lacks originality."
