    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verbs to express tense in a sentence. In this choice, the future tense verb \"will learn,\" used in conjunction with the phrase \"in a later chapter,\" correctly indicates that \"you\" (the reader) are going to learn about obsidian's structure at some point in the future.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because the past perfect verb \"had learned\" doesn't indicate that the subject is going to learn about obsidian's structure in the future.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because the past perfect progressive verb \"had been learning\" doesn't indicate that the subject is going to learn about obsidian's structure in the future.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because the present perfect verb \"have learned\" doesn't indicate that the subject is going to learn about obsidian's structure in the future."
