    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. The word \"from\" introduces a prepositional phrase that modifies the noun \"pages\" and provides essential information about their origin. No additional punctuation is needed after \"from\" in this context.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error, illogically separating the preposition \"from\" from the rest of the prepositional phrase with a colon. Also, a colon can only follow an independent clause, but what comes before the blank could not stand on its own as a complete sentence.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error, illogically separating the preposition \"from\" from the rest of the prepositional phrase with a comma.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error, illogically separating the preposition \"from\" from the rest of the prepositional phrase with a dash."
