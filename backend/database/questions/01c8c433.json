    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. \"Consequently\" logically signals that the postal problems described in this sentence (slow fee collection, heaps of undeliverable mail) were a consequence of the fee system described in the previous sentence.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because \"regardless\" illogically signals that the postal problems described in this sentence occurred despite the fee system described in the previous sentence. Instead, they were a consequence of that system.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because \"on the contrary\" illogically signals that the postal problems described in this sentence contrast with the fee system described in the previous sentence. Instead, they were a consequence of that system.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because \"for example\" illogically signals that the postal problems described in this sentence are an example of the fee system described in the previous sentence. Instead, they were a consequence of that system."
