  ],
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "A": "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim that Wheatley addresses her poem \"On Virtue\" to the quality of virtue, imploring it to assist her in reaching a future goal. In the quotation, Wheatley begs virtue to accompany her, or \"attend [her],\" through her youth and to \"guide [her] steps to\" the future goal of \"endless life and bliss.\"",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because this quotation suggests the difficulty of fully comprehending virtue. Rather than asking virtue for help, Wheatley presents it as a quality that is impossible to entirely understand because it is so grand and deep.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because this quotation describes Wheatley's effort to comprehend virtue despite virtue itself declaring that such wisdom is beyond her grasp, or \"higher than a fool can reach.\"",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because rather than asking virtue for help in this quotation, Wheatley urges herself to \"sink not into despair\" because virtue is always nearby."
