    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation between a verb and a prepositional phrase. No punctuation is needed between the verb \"blend\" and the prepositional phrase \"with Charlie Adams's delightfully catchy vocal melodies.\" The prepositional phrase completes the idea of the sentence, explaining with what Koperqualuk's guitar riffs blend.",
