  "passage": "Researchers wanted to study how consumers' reactions to an ad may be affected by other ads. The researchers began by showing study participants an ad for a product, with some seeing a less detailed ad and others seeing a more detailed one. Then, all participants viewed the same second ad for a store and shared their opinion of the store based on this second ad. Participants who had first seen an ad less detailed than the second ad had a higher opinion of the store than the participants who had first seen a more detailed ad. The researchers concluded that reactions to an ad may be affected by ______ blank",

  "answer_rationales": {
    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. The passage tells us that participants who had seen a less detailed ad for a product beforehand had a higher opinion of the store than those who had seen a more detailed ad. This suggests that reactions to an ad may be affected by the amount of detail viewed in previous ads.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention the number of people who viewed the ad, so there's no basis for this inference.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention the length of time viewing previous ads, so there's no basis for this inference.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention the time of day that the ad is viewed, so there's no basis for this inference."
