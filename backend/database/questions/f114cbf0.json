    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. \"By contrast\" logically signals that the information in this sentence—that a firefly's glow ceases when it stops drawing in oxygen—contrasts with the previous sentence's discussion of the processes that cause a firefly to begin to glow.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because \"for instance\" illogically signals that the information in the sentence exemplifies the previous sentence's discussion of how a firefly begins to glow. Instead, it contrasts with the previous sentence's discussion.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because \"specifically\" illogically signals that the information in the sentence provides specific details elaborating on the previous sentence's discussion of how a firefly begins to glow. Instead, it contrasts with the previous sentence's discussion.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because \"in conclusion\" illogically signals that the information in the sentence sums up the previous sentence's discussion of how a firefly begins to glow. Instead, it contrasts with the previous sentence's discussion."
