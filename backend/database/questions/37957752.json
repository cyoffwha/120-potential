  "passage": "As biologist Terrie Williams has documented, deep dives present a challenge for seals and other marine mammals. A seal must exert enough energy to propel itself hundreds of meters downward, while keeping its heart rate low enough that it doesn't run out of oxygen while underwater. ______ blank a seal moves its flippers as little as possible on a deep dive, gliding to conserve energy.",

  "answer_options": [
    "In the first place,",
    "On the other hand,",
    "For this reason,",
    "In comparison,"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. \"For this reason\" logically signals that the behavior described in this sentence is a consequence of the information about seals in the previous sentence. That is, a seal moves its flippers as little as possible during a deep dive because it needs to keep its heart rate low enough that it does not run out of oxygen.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because \"in the first place\" illogically signals that this sentence is the first point in a discussion. Instead, the sentence describes a behavior that is a consequence of the previous information about seals.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because \"on the other hand\" illogically signals that the behavior described in this sentence contrasts with the previous information about seals. Instead, it is a consequence of that information.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because \"in comparison\" illogically signals that the behavior described in this sentence is being compared to the previous information about seals. Instead, it is a consequence of that information."
