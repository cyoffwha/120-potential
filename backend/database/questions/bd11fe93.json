    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verb forms within a sentence. The nonfinite to-infinitive verb \"to study\" is correctly used to form a subordinate clause that indicates what Dr. Caballero-Gill uses chemistry and fossil evidence for (to study oceans as they were in the past).",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The finite verb \"has studied\" can't be used in this way to form a subordinate clause that indicates what Dr. Caballero-Gill uses the evidence for.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The finite verb \"studied\" can't be used in this way to form a subordinate clause that indicates what Dr. Caballero-Gill uses the evidence for.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The finite verb \"studies\" can't be used in this way to form a subordinate clause that indicates what Dr. Caballero-Gill uses the evidence for."
