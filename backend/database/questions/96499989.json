    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested here is punctuation between a verb and object. No punctuation is needed between the verb (\"appreciate\") and its object (\"the multiple references...\"). The object helps complete the idea of the verb—in this case, it explains what fans of science fiction will appreciate—and any punctuation between the two results in an ungrammatical sentence.",
