  "answer_rationales": {
    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. \"Vivid\" can mean \"colorful\" or \"bright-colored.\" This definition fits the context clues about Alem&aacute;n's fascination with and passion for bold colors.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This doesn't fit the logic of the text. Nothing in the text indicates that Alem&aacute;n's artworks are \"unknown.\"",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. This doesn't fit the logic of the text. \"Definite\" means \"certain\" or \"decided.\" It wouldn't make sense to describe artwork as \"definite.\"",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This doesn't fit the logic of the text. \"Reserved\" can either mean \"slow to reveal emotions\" or \"booked.\" But the clues suggest that Alem&aacute;n's artworks are boldly colorfulâ€”almost the opposite of \"reserved.\""
