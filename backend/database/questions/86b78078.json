    "In 1956, Trinidadian author Samuel Selvon published one of his most celebrated novels,  The Lonely Londoners,  which is about a group of men who emigrate from the Caribbean to Great Britain after World War II.",
    "Samuel Selvon wrote the novel&nbsp; Moses Ascending&nbsp; after he wrote&nbsp; The Lonely Londoners.&nbsp;",

  ],
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. By noting that Selvon is a Trinidadian author and indicating that The Lonely Londoners , published in 1956, is about a group of men who emigrate from the Caribbean to Great Britain after World War II, the sentence effectively introduces Samuel Selvon and his novel to a new audience.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. The sentence indicates the order in which two of Selvon's novels were written; it doesn't introduce Samuel Selvon and The Lonely Londoners to a new audience.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence describes the novel The Lonely Londoners , it doesn't mention its author, Samuel Selvon, by name and thus doesn't effectively introduce him to a new audience.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. The sentence indicates that two of Selvon's novels include the same characters; it doesn't introduce Samuel Selvon and The Lonely Londoners to a new audience."
