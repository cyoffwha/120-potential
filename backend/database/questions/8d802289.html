<p>Dance choreographer Alvin Ailey&rsquo;s deep admiration for jazz music can most clearly be felt in the rhythms and beats his works were set to. Ailey collaborated with some of the greatest jazz legends, like Charles Mingus, Charlie Parker, and perhaps his favorite, Duke Ellington. With his choice of music, Ailey helped bring jazz to life for his audiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span role="heading" aria-level="2"><strong>Text 2</strong></span></p>
<p>Jazz is present throughout Ailey&rsquo;s work, but it&rsquo;s most visible in Ailey&rsquo;s approach to choreography. Ailey often incorporated improvisation, a signature characteristic of jazz music, in his work. When managing his dance company, Ailey rarely forced his dancers to an exact set of specific moves. Instead, he encouraged his dancers to let their own skills and experiences shape their performances, as jazz musicians do.</p></div>
