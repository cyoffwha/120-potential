  "passage": "A group of ecologists led by Axel Mith&ouml;fer at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Germany examined the defensive responses of two varieties of the sweet potato ______ blank TN57, which is known for its insect resistance, and TN66, which is much more susceptible to pests.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between a main clause and a supplementary phrase. In this choice, a colon is correctly used to mark the boundary between the main clause (\"A group&hellip;plant\") and the supplementary element (\"TN57&hellip;pests\") and to introduce the following elaboration on the specific varieties of sweet potato plants that were examined.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with \"TN57.\"",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because a semicolon can't be used in this way to join the main clause (\"A group&hellip;plant\") and the supplementary element (\"TN57&hellip;pests\"). A semicolon is conventionally used to join two main clauses, whereas a colon is conventionally used to introduce an element that explains or amplifies the information in the preceding clause.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the main clause (\"A group...plant\") and the supplementary element (\"TN57...pests\") with appropriate punctuation."
