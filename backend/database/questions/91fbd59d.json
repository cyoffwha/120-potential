  "answer_rationales": {
    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation between a supplementary element and a main clause. This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the supplementary phrase (\"While...1947\"), which indicates when the action occurred, and the main clause (\"Howe had a handheld camera operator wear roller skates\").",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because a comma paired with the conjunction \"and\" can't be used in this way to mark the boundary between the supplementary element (\"While&hellip;1947\") and the main clause (\"Howe&hellip;skates\").",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because the conjunction \"and\" can't be used in this way to join the supplementary element (\"While&hellip;1947\") and the main clause (\"Howe&hellip;skates\").",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the supplementary element and the main clause with appropriate punctuation."
