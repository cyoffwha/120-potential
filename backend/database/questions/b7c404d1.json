    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. \"Indeed\" logically signals that the information in this sentence—that Laleh Mehran's installation resembled both a typical movie theater and a coal mine—supports the previous sentence's claim that the space Mehran created felt both \"familiar and distant.\"",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because \"next\" illogically signals that the description of Laleh Mehran's installation in this sentence is the next step in a process. Rather, it supports the previous sentence's claim about Mehran's installation.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because \"nevertheless\" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is true despite the claim about Laleh Mehran's installation in the previous sentence. Rather, it supports that claim.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because \"instead\" illogically signals that this sentence presents an alternative to the previous sentence's claim about Laleh Mehran's installation. Rather, it supports that claim."
