  "passage": "Economist Marco Castillo and colleagues showed that nuisance costs—the time and effort people must spend to make donations—reduce charitable giving. Charities can mitigate this effect by compensating donors for nuisance costs, but those costs, though variable, are largely ______ blank donation size, so charities that compensate donors will likely favor attracting a few large donors over many small donors.",

  "answer_rationales": {
    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. We're told that charities that pay donors back for nuisance costs will attract a few large donors instead of many small donors. This suggests that nuisance costs are not linked to donation size.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. This doesn't fit the logic of the text. If nuisance costs are supplemental to (meaning in addition to) donation size, that wouldn't result in charities that compensate donors for those costs attracting a few large donors over many small donors.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect. This doesn't fit the logic of the text. If nuisance costs can predict donation size, that wouldn't necessarily result in charities that compensate donors for those costs attracting a few large donors over many small donors.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect. This doesn't fit the logic of the text. If nuisance costs are subsumed in (meaning included in) donation size, that wouldn't result in charities that compensate donors for those costs attracting a few large donors over many small donors."
