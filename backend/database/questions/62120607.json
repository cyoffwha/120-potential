  "passage": "From afar, African American fiber artist Bisa Butler's portraits look like paintings, their depictions of human faces, bodies, and clothing so intricate that it seems only a fine brush could have rendered them. When viewed up close, however, the portraits reveal themselves to be ______ blank stitching barely visible among the thousands of pieces of printed, microcut fabric.",

  "answer_rationales": {
    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between a main clause and a supplementary phrase. This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the main clause (\"the portraits...quilts\") and the supplementary noun phrase (\"the stitching...fabric\") that provides a further description of how the portraits can be identified as quilts.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect. A comma and the conjunction \"and\" can't be used in this way to join a main clause and a supplementary noun phrase.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because a semicolon can't be used in this way to join a main clause and a supplementary noun phrase.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with \"the stitching.\""
