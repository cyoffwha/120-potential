                	<p>Choice A is the best answer.

This doesn&rsquo;t make sense. John doesn&rsquo;t want his mother to apologize for his own desire to travel&mdash;he wants her to accept his desire to travel. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that John wants his mother to match his desire to travel. Rather, he wants her to accept his desire to travel even though she doesn&rsquo;t like it. Choice D is incorrect. This is tempting, because it seems to pick up on the idea of people &ldquo;reconciling&rdquo; after a fight, but it actually doesn&rsquo;t make sense. The text never suggests that John&rsquo;s mother was &ldquo;united with&rdquo; the idea of him traveling in the past&mdash;if anything, it seems like she&rsquo;s always been against it. Besides, it would be strange to say that a person &ldquo;reunites with&rdquo; a notion. </p>
