    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of punctuation between titles and proper nouns. No punctuation is needed to offset the proper noun \"Yuree Lee\" form the title \"plant cell biologist\" that describes Lee.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because no punctuation is needed.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because no punctuation is needed.",
