  "correct_answer": "B",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "B": "Choice B is the best answer. \"As a result\" logically signals that the information in this sentence about Amaya leaving Spain to perform abroad is a result of the previous information about the Spanish Civil War.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because \"in comparison\" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is being compared to the previous information about the Spanish Civil War. Instead, Amaya leaving Spain is a result of that war.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because \"first of all\" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is the beginning of a sequence of events. Instead, Amaya leaving Spain is a result of the event (the outbreak of war) described in the previous sentence.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because \"for example\" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is an example supporting the previous statement about the Spanish Civil War. Instead, Amaya leaving Spain is a result of that war."
