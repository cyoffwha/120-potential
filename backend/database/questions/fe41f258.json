    "A": "Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between a main clause and a participial phrase. This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the main clause (\"Epicurus&hellip;&lsquo;soul'\") and the participial phrase (\"positing&hellip;absence\") that provides additional information about how Epicurus defined pleasure.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because a colon can't be used in this way to join a main clause and a participial phrase.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because a semicolon can't be used in this way to join a main clause and a participial phrase.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with \"positing.\""
