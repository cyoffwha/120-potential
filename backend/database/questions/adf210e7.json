    "D": "Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between a main clause and a supplementary phrase. This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the main clause (\"The haiku-like&hellip;writers\") and the supplementary phrase (\"among&hellip;Cole\") that specifies a contemporary writer who has praised Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer's haiku-like poems.",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with \"among.\"",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the main clause and the supplementary phrase with appropriate punctuation.",
    "C": "Choice C is incorrect because a semicolon can't be used in this way to join the main clause (\"The haiku-like&hellip;writers\") and the supplementary phrase (\"among&hellip;Cole\")."
