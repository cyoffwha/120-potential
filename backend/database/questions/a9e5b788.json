  "passage": "In discussing Mary Shelley's 1818 epistolary novel Frankenstein , literary theorist Gayatri Spivak directs the reader's attention to the character of Margaret Saville. As Spivak points out, Saville is not the protagonist of Shelley's ______ blank as the recipient of the letters that frame the book's narrative, she's the \"occasion\" of it.",

    "novel",

    "novel; rather,",
    "novel, rather,"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "answer_rationales": {
    "C": "Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice correctly uses a semicolon to join a main clause (\"Saville...novel\") and a second main clause (\"she's...it\") preceded by supplementary elements (\"rather...narrative\").",
    "A": "Choice A is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.",
    "B": "Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can't be used in this way to join two main clauses.",
    "D": "Choice D is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, the comma after \"novel\" can't be used in this way to join the two main clauses."
