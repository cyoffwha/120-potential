The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the\nnumber of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can\nonly be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means\nthere must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues’ count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri’s count. The\ntext goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms’ morphological\nvariability, or the differences in microorganisms’ structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify\nmicroorganisms by species and means that researchers’ decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect\non the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar\nnumbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from\ndifferences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated\nsome of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas\nBianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many\nmore species than Bianchi and Morri did.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate\nspecies in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the\nstudies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues’ count and Bianchi and Morri’s\ncount that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of\nBianchi and Morri’s study. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been\nless sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues\nwere. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and\nMorri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation\nwould lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as\nvariations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll\nand colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and\nMorri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report\nfewer overall species. Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported\nmany more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and\ncolleagues would not explain that difference—it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should\nhave been even larger.\n\nQuestion Difficulty: Hard",

The diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature, which coincided with the\nrise of photography, seems to support this claim. However, photography’s impact on the portrait miniature may be\noverstated. Although records from art exhibitions in the Netherlands from 1820 to 1892 show a decrease in the number of\nboth full-sized and miniature portraits submitted, this trend was established before the invention of photography.\n\nBased on the text, what can be concluded about the diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature in the nineteenth\ncentury?\n\nA. Factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature’s decline.\n\nAlthough portrait miniatures became less common than photographs, they were widely regarded as having more artistic\nB. merit.\n\nC. The popularity of the portrait miniature likely persisted for longer than art historians have assumed.\n\nD. As demand for portrait miniatures decreased, portrait artists likely shifted their creative focus to photography.\n\nID: 87aa7bab Answer\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nRationale\n\nChoice A is the best answer. The text says that the impact of photography on the portrait miniature might be \"overstated,\" as\nsome records show a decrease in the number of portrait miniatures before the invention of photography. From this, we can\nconclude that factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature’s decline.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. The text never discusses the \"artistic merit\" of either art form. Choice C is incorrect. The text never\nsuggests that the portrait miniature was popular for longer than historians thought—if anything, it suggests that the portrait\nminiature started losing its popularity earlier than historians thought. Choice D is incorrect. The text never suggests that\nportrait painters shifted to become photographers.\n\nQuestion Difficulty: Medium",

It ruled out a potential alternative explanation for the acceleration in microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling.\n\nIt clarified that microorganism activity levels in the plant-soil cores varied depending on which microorganisms\nD. comprised the community.\n\nID: 458b4a11 Answer\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nRationale\n\nChoice C is the best answer because it accurately describes why the finding about the microorganism community\ncomposition was important. The text describes an experiment by Eva KaStovska and her team in which they collected plant-\nsoil cores at one elevation and transplanted them to sites at a lower elevation, where the mean air temperature was warmer.\nKaStovska and her team observed that microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores\nand that \"crucially, microorganism community composition was unchanged,’ which allowed the team to attribute the\nacceleration to changes in microorganism activity brought about by the difference in temperature. This strongly implies that\nthe team wouldn't have been able to make that attribution otherwise, meaning that a change in microorganism composition\nrepresented another possible explanation for the acceleration that had to be ruled out.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text says microorganism-mediated cycling of soil nutrients increased in the transplanted\ncores, this is unrelated to what’s important about the finding that the microorganism composition didn’t change—that it\nallowed the team to attribute the change in activity solely to the change in temperature. Choice B is incorrect. Although the\ntext compares activity in one core at two different elevations, the text doesn’t address changes in activity at various\nelevations over time. Choice D is incorrect. Although different microorganisms likely exhibit different levels of activity, the\ntext indicates that there was no change in microorganism composition, and there is nothing in the text about different\nmicroorganisms having different activity levels.\nQuestion Difficulty: Hard",

Elinor lives with her younger sisters and her\n\nmother, Mrs. Dashwood.\nElinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding, and coolness of\njudgment, which qualified her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and enabled her frequently to\ncounteract, to the advantage of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to\nimprudence. She had an excellent heart;—her disposition was affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew\nhow to govern them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which one of her sisters had resolved\nnever to be taught.\n\nAccording to the text, what is true about Elinor?\n\nA. Elinor often argues with her mother but fails to change her mind.\nB. Elinor can be overly sensitive with regard to family matters.\nC. Elinor thinks her mother is a bad role model.\n\nD. Elinor is remarkably mature for her age.\n\nID: 3543e6e2 Answer\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nRationale\n\nChoice D is the best answer because it provides a detail about Elinor that is established in the text. The text indicates that\nalthough Elinor is “only nineteen,” she gives good advice and exhibits such a high level of understanding and judgment that\nshe serves as “the counsellor of her mother.” Thus, Elinor is mature beyond her years.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it isn’t supported by the text: although the text says that Elinor advises her mother and often\ncounteracts her mother’s impulses, there's no mention of Elinor arguing with her mother or failing to change her mother's\nmind. Choice B is incorrect because it isn’t supported by the text: although the text mentions that Elinor has strong feelings,\nit doesn’t indicate that she’s excessively sensitive when it comes to family issues. Choice C is incorrect because it isn't\nsupported by the text: there’s no mention of what Elinor thinks about her mother and no suggestion that she thinks her\nmother is a bad role model. Because she’s described as having “an excellent heart,” Elinor likely doesn't think ill of her\nmother.\n\nQuestion Difficulty: Easy",

In the film The Godfather Part II, the fabula is the story of the Corleone family, and the syuzhet is the\npresentation of the story as it alternates between two timelines in 1901 and 1958.

The text begins by explaining that\nmany literary theorists rely on the concepts of fabula (a narrative's content) and syuzhet (a narrative’s arrangement and\npresentation of events) and illustrates these concepts by explaining how they can be applied to the film The Godfather Part II.\nThe text then discusses how Mikhail Bakhtin, a literary theorist, argued that fabula and syuzhet can't fully describe a\nnarrative, since systematic categorizations such as these fail to account for all the ways in which interactions between the\nartist, the work, and the audience produce meaning. Thus, the main idea is that Bakhtin argued that there are important\ncharacteristics of narratives that are not fully encompassed by two concepts that other theorists have used to analyze\nnarratives.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because according to the text, Mikhail Bakhtin believed that meaning was created through the\ninteractions of the artist, narrative, and audience, not simply through the interaction between the audience and narrative;\nmoreover, the text doesn't address whether Bakhtin focused on the ways in which different people interpret narratives\ndifferently. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text implies that the storytelling methods used in The Godfather Part II are\ncomplicated, it discusses the film only to illustrate how the concepts of fabula and syuzhet may be applied to a narrative. The\nfilm’s storytelling methods aren't the primary focus of the text. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses The Godfather Part\nI, whose narrative doesn’t adhere to a single chronological order, only to illustrate the concepts of fabula (a narrative's\ncontent) and syuzhet (a narrative’s arrangement and presentation of events). The primary focus of this text isn’t the structure\nof this film or of other narratives that are told out of chronological order; moreover, the text doesn’t consider whether such\nstructures make it harder for audiences to understand narratives.\n\nQuestion Difficulty: Hard",
